# Using a GPG Encryption Plugin in Obsidian: Workflows and Considerations

This guide describes the typical functionalities, workflows, and important considerations for using a GnuPG (GPG) encryption plugin within the Obsidian note-taking application. It aims to help users understand how such a plugin can be leveraged for protecting sensitive information directly within their notes, especially when integrating with hardware security keys like a Feitian K9D.

> **Important Disclaimer: Conceptual Guide**
> This guide is conceptual and based on common features found in GPG integration tools and plugins designed for text editors or note-taking applications. Since a specific "gpg-encrypt" plugin for Obsidian was not detailed beyond its name in the initial context for this documentation, **users MUST refer to the specific documentation, settings, and capabilities of the actual Obsidian GPG plugin they choose to install.** Features, command names, user interface elements, and configuration options will vary between different community plugins. Always consult the chosen plugin's official guide for accurate setup and usage instructions.

## I. User Guide: Encrypting Note Content with an Obsidian GPG Plugin

### A. Introduction to Plugin-Based Encryption

#### 1. Purpose
This part of the guide explains how to use a hypothetical GnuPG (GPG) plugin within Obsidian to encrypt and decrypt the content of your notes. This allows you to protect sensitive information directly within your Obsidian vault.

#### 2. Benefits
*   **Convenient Protection:** Encrypt and decrypt information directly within the Obsidian interface, streamlining your workflow.
*   **Integration with System GPG:** The plugin leverages your existing GPG installation, meaning it can work with GPG keys managed on hardware security keys like the Feitian K9D.
*   **Selective Encryption:** Choose to encrypt entire notes or just specific sections of text, allowing for granular control over what is protected.

#### 3. Assumed Plugin Functionality (Hypothetical)
This guide is based on a hypothetical GPG plugin for Obsidian with the following core capabilities:
*   Encrypting selected text within a note.
*   Decrypting GPG-encrypted blocks of text within a note.
*   Allowing the user to select GPG recipients for encryption.
*   Interacting with the system's GPG installation, `gpg-agent`, and any connected hardware keys (like a Feitian K9D).

#### 4. Prerequisites
Before using such a plugin, ensure you have the following setup:
1.  **GnuPG Installed and Configured:** A working GnuPG (GPG) installation on your system (including `gpg`, `gpg-agent`, `scdaemon` if using smart cards, and a `pinentry` program). Refer to official GPG documentation for installation.
2.  **Your GPG Key Pair:** You must have your own GPG key pair (public and private keys).
    *   **Highly Recommended:** Your private key should be stored on a hardware security key like a Feitian K9D (see the "Feitian K9D: GPG Setup and Hardware-Backed Git Commit Signing Guide" for setup details).
3.  **`gpg-agent` Running:** Ensure `gpg-agent` is running and configured correctly to handle PIN entry and smart card operations.
4.  **Recipient Public Keys Imported:** To encrypt content for others (or for yourself for later decryption), you must have the recipients' public GPG keys imported into your GPG keyring and ideally validated (fingerprint checked).

### B. Plugin Installation and Setup (Hypothetical)

This section describes a typical installation and setup process for a community GPG plugin in Obsidian. **The exact steps and available settings will vary based on the actual plugin you choose.**

#### 1. Installation
1.  Open Obsidian.
2.  Go to **Settings** -> **Community plugins**.
3.  Turn off "Safe mode" if it's enabled (at your own discretion, understanding the risks of community plugins).
4.  Click **Browse** to open the community plugin browser.
5.  Search for a GPG encryption plugin (e.g., "GPG Encrypt," "Obsidian GPG," or similar terms).
6.  Review the plugin description and developer information before clicking **Install**.
7.  Once installed, find the plugin in the "Installed plugins" list and **enable it** using the toggle switch.

#### 2. Typical Plugin Settings
After installation, the plugin will likely have settings that you can configure. Access these via **Settings** -> **Community plugins** -> (Plugin Name).

**Key User Configuration Options / Operator Variables (Examples - will vary by plugin):**
These settings allow you to customize the plugin's behavior.

*   **`Default GPG Key ID for Signing` (if plugin supports signing plaintext):**
    *   **User Configuration:** Your GPG Key ID to be used by default if the plugin offers a separate plaintext signing feature (distinct from encryption).
*   **`Default Recipient(s) for Encryption`:**
    *   **User Configuration:** You might be able to specify one or more GPG Key IDs or email addresses to be automatically included as recipients.
    *   **Crucial:** It's highly recommended to **always include your own GPG Key ID as a default recipient** if you intend to decrypt the content yourself later.
*   **`Output Format for Encrypted Blocks`:**
    *   **User Configuration:**
        *   `ASCII Armor` (Recommended): Produces a text-based GPG block (e.g., `-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----...`).
        *   `Binary`: Produces binary encrypted output.
*   **`Clipboard Handling for Decryption`:**
    *   **User Configuration:**
        *   `Replace selection/block with decrypted text`.
        *   `Copy decrypted text to clipboard` (can be more secure for very sensitive data).
        *   `Show in a temporary modal/popup`.
*   **`UI Customization Options`:**
    *   **User Configuration:** Options for context menu entries, command palette names, etc.

#### 3. Initial Check
*   After installation and configuration, open the Command Palette (usually `Ctrl+P` or `Cmd+P`) and search for commands related to "GPG," "Encrypt," or "Decrypt" to verify the plugin has registered its actions.
*   Check context menus (right-click) for plugin-added options.

### C. Encryption Workflow within Obsidian

This describes how you would typically encrypt content within a note using the plugin.

#### 1. Encrypting Selected Text
1.  **Select Text:** Highlight the portion of text within your note to encrypt.
2.  **Trigger Encryption:** Use the Command Palette or context menu for the plugin's encryption command.
3.  **Recipient Selection Process:**
    *   The plugin should prompt for recipient(s) (GPG Key IDs/emails).
    *   **Operator Variable:** The list of GPG Key IDs/emails for this specific encryption.
    *   **Crucial Reminder:** **Always include your own GPG Key ID as a recipient** if you need to decrypt this content later.
4.  **GPG/Hardware Key (e.g., Feitian K9D) Interaction:**
    *   The plugin calls your system's `gpg` command.
    *   `gpg-agent` handles key access.
    *   If using a Feitian K9D or similar hardware key:
        *   **Expect a PIN prompt** from `pinentry` for your K9D User PIN.
        *   **Expect K9D physical interaction:** Your K9D may blink or require a physical touch to authorize the operation (verify your specific K9D model's behavior).
5.  **Output:** The selected plaintext is typically replaced by an ASCII armored GPG block.

#### 2. Encrypting an Entire Note (If Supported)
*   **Process:** Similar to selected text; trigger an "Encrypt entire note" command, select recipients (including self), and interact with GPG/K9D.
*   **Output:** The note body is replaced by a GPG block.
*   **Frontmatter Handling:** YAML Frontmatter is usually **not encrypted** by content-focused plugins.

### D. Decryption Workflow within Obsidian

#### 1. Triggering Decryption
*   Place cursor within or select a GPG-encrypted block.
*   Trigger the decryption command (Command Palette or context menu).

#### 2. GPG/Hardware Key (e.g., Feitian K9D) Interaction
*   The plugin calls `gpg`.
*   `gpg-agent` handles private key access.
*   If using a Feitian K9D:
    *   **Expect a PIN prompt** for your K9D User PIN.
    *   **Expect K9D physical interaction:** Your K9D may require a touch (verify model behavior).

#### 3. Output/Display of Decrypted Content
*   Methods vary by plugin and **User Configuration**:
    *   Inline temporary replacement.
    *   Modal/popup window.
    *   Copy to clipboard.

#### 4. Handling Decryption Failures
*   The plugin should provide feedback (notification, error message) if decryption fails (e.g., wrong key, incorrect PIN, K9D not connected).

### E. Managing Recipients for Plugin Use
The plugin uses your system's GPG keyring.
*   **Import Public Keys:** `gpg --import <keyfile.asc>` or `gpg --search-keys <email>`.
*   **Validate Public Keys:** **Crucially, verify fingerprints out-of-band** (`gpg --fingerprint <key_id>`) before trusting and encrypting to them. Optionally, sign trusted keys.

### F. Common Use Cases for In-Note Encryption
*   Storing secrets (API keys, passwords).
*   Drafting confidential sections of notes.
*   Sharing encrypted snippets via other communication channels.
*   Keeping sensitive personal logs or journal entries.

### G. Security Considerations with an Obsidian GPG Plugin
*   **Plugin Trust:** You are trusting the community plugin's code. Review its reputation and source if possible.
*   **Underlying GPG Security:** Relies on your system's GPG setup, key management, and K9D security (strong PINs, physical protection).
*   **Decrypted Content Handling:**
    *   Plaintext exists in Obsidian's memory when decrypted.
    *   Clipboard data can be vulnerable. Clear clipboard after use.
    *   Notes are plaintext; only GPG blocks are encrypted.
*   **Scope of Encryption:** Plugin encrypts *content within* notes, not entire files automatically on the filesystem or linked attachments.
*   **Secure `gpg-agent` and `pinentry`:** Essential for secure PIN handling.

## II. Integrating Plugin-Based GPG Encryption into Your Obsidian Workflows

### A. Introduction to Workflow Integration
This part discusses practical ways to integrate a GPG encryption plugin into your daily Obsidian workflows and addresses its limitations, especially concerning automated encryption based on document classification. The focus is on effectively using the *manual* tools provided by a typical Obsidian GPG plugin.

### B. Manual Nature of Classification-Based Encryption

#### User Responsibility is Key
A GPG plugin for Obsidian provides *manual tools* for encryption/decryption. It does **not** automatically:
*   Detect content sensitivity or classification (e.g., L1, L2).
*   Encrypt content based on folder location or frontmatter tags.
*   Select GPG recipients based on classification.

**The user is responsible for:**
*   **Identifying** sensitive content needing protection.
*   Manually **invoking** the plugin's encryption command.
*   Carefully **selecting correct GPG recipients** appropriate for the information's sensitivity.

### C. Conceptual "Automation" - Integrating with Other Obsidian Tools (Speculative)
True auto-encryption is unlikely, but other Obsidian tools might help *prompt* or *guide* manual GPG plugin use:

#### 1. Obsidian URI / Command Palette Integration
If the GPG plugin exposes commands (e.g., "GPG: Encrypt selection"), tools like `Templater` or `QuickAdd` could potentially:
*   Insert predefined structures for sensitive info.
*   Prompt the user for recipients.
*   Remind the user to invoke the GPG plugin's encryption command.
This is user-guided orchestration, not direct auto-encryption by the GPG plugin.

#### 2. Folder-Based Reminders or Note Templates
*   **Folder Naming:** Use clear folder names (e.g., `Secure/L1-Internal/`, `Projects/Alpha/L2-Data/`) as sensitivity reminders.
*   **Note Templates:** Use Obsidian's template features to insert reminders:
    ```markdown
    ---
    tags: L2, project-secret
    classification: L2
    ---
    **SECURITY REMINDER:** Content in this note is L2. 
    - [ ] Encrypt all sensitive sections before saving/committing.
    - [ ] Recipients: [self, specific_person@example.com]
    ```

#### 3. Limitations of "Automation"
These methods aid manual encryption. True, seamless automation (e.g., "auto-encrypt file on save if in 'L2-Secure' folder") is generally beyond typical GPG content plugins and would require external scripting or more advanced tools.

### D. Recipient Management Strategies for L1/L2 Information (using the Plugin)
Careful recipient selection is critical for L1/L2 data.

#### 1. User Discipline
*   **L1 (Internal):** Select recipients from within your organization/trusted team. Always include yourself for later decryption.
*   **L2 (Highly Sensitive):** Highly restricted recipient lists (e.g., specific individuals, plus yourself).
*   The plugin prompts for recipients; you must input the correct GPG Key IDs/emails.

#### 2. Using GPG Key Groups/Aliases (System-Level)
If the plugin allows flexible input for recipients, system-level GPG groups can help:
*   Define groups in `~/.gnupg/gpg.conf`:
    ```
    group project_alpha = keyid1, email2@example.com
    ```
*   If the plugin's recipient field accepts group names, GPG (called by the plugin) should expand it. Test with your specific plugin.
*   Alternatively, maintain text lists of recipients and copy-paste into the plugin prompt.

#### 3. Plugin Relies on System Keyring
The plugin uses your system's GPG keyring for public keys (encryption) and your private key (decryption via K9D).

### E. Secure Sharing Procedures using the Plugin

#### 1. Sender's Workflow:
1.  Select content in Obsidian.
2.  Invoke plugin encryption.
3.  Select recipient(s) (including self if needed for your own records).
4.  Authenticate with K9D (PIN/touch).
5.  Copy the resulting GPG block.
6.  Transmit the GPG block (e.g., via email).

#### 2. Recipient's Workflow:
1.  Paste GPG block into their Obsidian (or other GPG tool).
2.  Invoke decryption using their plugin/GPG.
3.  Authenticate with their private key/K9D (PIN/touch).
4.  View decrypted content.

#### 3. Advantages
*   End-to-end encryption.
*   Transport medium independent security for the GPG block.

### F. Limitations Regarding "Automated Workflows" and Logging

#### 1. No Automated Encryption by Classification
**Reiteration:** The plugin provides *manual tools*. It will not automatically scan notes or frontmatter (e.g., `classification: L1`) and encrypt content with predefined recipients. This requires more complex external systems.

#### 2. No User-Friendly Access Logging by Plugin/GPG
*   **Plugin:** Typically does not create user-facing logs of decryption attempts.
*   **GPG/`gpg-agent`:** Debugging logs are not suitable for user access auditing of encrypted note content.
*   If detailed access logging is required, dedicated document management systems with audit trails may be necessary.

### G. Best Practices for Using a GPG Plugin in Obsidian
*   **Keep Software Updated:** Update plugin, Obsidian, and GnuPG.
*   **Strong K9D PINs / GPG Passphrases.**
*   **Verify Recipient Keys OOB.**
*   **Encrypt to Self** if you need future access to the encrypted block.
*   **Mindful Handling of Decrypted Plaintext:** Minimize exposure, clear clipboard, be aware of temporary storage.
*   **Content-Level Encryption:** The plugin encrypts *content within* notes, not a replacement for full-disk or filesystem encryption.

By understanding these workflows, limitations, and best practices, you can effectively and securely integrate GPG encryption into your Obsidian note-taking, enhanced by the security of your Feitian K9D.
