# KSBC GitHub Guide for All Members

Welcome! This guide helps you navigate our GitHub organization and contribute effectively, regardless of your technical background.

## 🗂️ Where to Put Things: Repository Guide

### 📚 For Educational Content & Theory
**Repository: `quartz-website`**
- Reading group materials
- Political theory documents
- Educational resources
- Public-facing content

**Examples:**
- "Let's read State and Revolution"
- "Study guide for Capital Vol. 1"
- "Introduction to Democratic Centralism"

### 💬 For Discussions & Questions
**Use GitHub Discussions** (not the discussion repo)
- General questions
- Meeting planning
- Theoretical debates
- Announcements

**How to access:** Go to any repository → Click "Discussions" tab

### 🔧 For Technical Work
**Repository: `os`** (for DRUIDS/operating system work)
- DRUIDS feature requests
- OS bugs or improvements
- Technical documentation

**Repository: `DRUIDS`** (when it's set up)
- DRUIDS implementation details
- Plugin development
- Integration issues

### 🏢 For Organizational Work
**Repository: `.github`**
- Organization-wide policies
- GitHub setup issues
- Process improvements
- Templates and workflows

## 📝 How to Create an Issue

### Step 1: Choose the Right Repository
Use the guide above to pick the correct repository.

### Step 2: Navigate to Issues
1. Go to the repository
2. Click the "Issues" tab
3. Click green "New issue" button

### Step 3: Choose a Template (if available)
We have templates for:
- 📋 Proposals
- 🐛 Bug reports
- 📚 Educational content
- 🔧 Technical tasks

### Step 4: Fill Out the Issue
**Title:** Be specific!
- ❌ Bad: "Website broken"
- ✅ Good: "Login button not working on mobile devices"

**Description:** Include:
- What you want to do/fix
- Why it's important
- Any relevant context

### Step 5: Add Labels
Look for these common labels:
- `documentation` - for writing tasks
- `good first issue` - for beginners
- `help wanted` - if you need assistance
- `priority:high` - for urgent items

## 🏷️ Understanding Our Labels

### Priority Levels
- `p0-critical` - Drop everything!
- `p1-high` - This week
- `p2-medium` - This month
- `p3-low` - When we can

### Types
- `enhancement` - New features
- `bug` - Something's broken
- `documentation` - Writing/docs
- `discussion` - Needs group input

### Status
- `blocked` - Waiting on something else
- `in-progress` - Someone's working on it
- `review` - Ready for feedback

## 🎯 Quick Decision Tree

**"I want to suggest..."**

1. **A new article or educational material**
   → Create issue in `quartz-website`
   → Use "Educational Content" template

2. **A change to how we organize**
   → Create issue in `.github`
   → Use "Proposal" template

3. **A technical feature for DRUIDS**
   → Create issue in `os` (for now)
   → Use "Enhancement" template

4. **I found something broken**
   → Create issue where you found it
   → Use "Bug Report" template

5. **I have a question**
   → Use GitHub Discussions
   → Don't create an issue

## 🆘 Getting Help

### If you're stuck:
1. Check if someone already created a similar issue (use search)
2. Ask in GitHub Discussions
3. Tag `@ks-sbc/cadre` in your issue for help
4. Message on Signal/Matrix for urgent items

### Common Mistakes to Avoid:
- ❌ Creating duplicate issues (search first!)
- ❌ Putting issues in wrong repos
- ❌ Using issues for questions (use Discussions)
- ❌ Forgetting to add labels
- ❌ Being too vague in descriptions

## 📊 Understanding Projects

We use "Projects" to track larger initiatives:
- **DRUIDS Implementation Roadmap** - Technical development
- **KSBC Operations** - Organizational work

You don't need to add issues to projects - maintainers will do this.

## 🔐 Security Levels

Some content has security classifications:
- `security:public` - Anyone can see
- `security:candidate` - Candidates and above
- `security:cadre` - Cadre only

Don't put sensitive information in public repos!

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Use the search bar** - It searches everything!
2. **Subscribe to issues** - Click "Subscribe" to get updates
3. **Use reactions** - 👍 issues you support
4. **Link related issues** - Type # followed by issue number
5. **Preview your markdown** - Click "Preview" tab before submitting

## 📱 Mobile Users

GitHub mobile app makes it easier:
1. Download "GitHub" from app store
2. Sign in with your account
3. Browse to `ks-sbc` organization
4. Create issues directly from phone!

**Remember:** It's better to create an issue in the "wrong" place than not create one at all. We can always move it! 🚀
