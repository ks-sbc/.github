## Democratic Centralist Workflow

Our contribution process follows a democratic centralist model:

1. **Discussion Phase**: Open and thorough discussion of issues and proposals
2. **Decision Phase**: Formal decision through democratic process
3. **Implementation Phase**: Unified action to implement decisions
4. **Review Phase**: Critical evaluation of implementation

Once a decision has been made through proper channels, all members are expected to work toward its implementation regardless of their position during the discussion phase.

## Security Classification System

We operate with a three-tier security classification system:

### Public (L0)
- General educational content and resources
- Available in public repositories
- Can be shared freely

### Candidate (L1)
- Development materials for potential cadre
- Limited to contributors with appropriate clearance
- Not for public distribution

### Cadre (L2)
- Strategic and operational documentation
- Strict need-to-know basis
- Highly restricted access

**Always verify the appropriate security classification before contributing content.**

## Getting Started

1. **Familiarize yourself with our structure**:
   - Review our repositories and documentation
   - Understand our democratic centralist workflow
   - Learn about our security model

2. **Set up your environment**:
   - Install Obsidian with required plugins
   - Configure standard linting and formatting rules
   - Set up Git with appropriate credentials

3. **Understand our standards**:
   - Review documentation templates
   - Familiarize yourself with our YAML frontmatter requirements
   - Learn our tag taxonomy

## Technical Contributions

If you have technical skills, consider helping with:

- GitHub Actions workflow development
- Obsidian plugin configuration and scripting
- Security model implementation
- Documentation system automation

Technical contributors should consult our [Development Guide](./docs/development.md) for coding standards and technical requirements.

## Non-Technical Contributions

There are many valuable ways to contribute without technical expertise:

### Documentation & Content Creation

- **Create Document Templates**  
  Design Markdown templates for frequently used document types with clear placeholder text.

- **Develop Visual Security Classification Guide**  
  Create visual explanations of our three-tier security model (L0/L1/L2) with examples.

- **Create Step-by-Step Workflow Guides**  
  Develop user-friendly guides showing common workflows with screenshots.

### Testing & User Experience

- **Conduct Usability Testing**  
  Test the system by following specific scenarios and document your experience.

- **Create Glossary of Terms**  
  Compile and define terms used throughout the system.

### Organization & Metadata

- **Organize Tag Taxonomy**  
  Help organize and structure the hierarchical tag system.

- **Review and Improve Error Messages**  
  Suggest more user-friendly alternatives to current error messages.

### Training Materials

- **Create FAQ Document**  
  Compile common questions and answers about using the system.

- **Develop Training Scenarios**  
  Create realistic scenarios for training exercises.

## Contribution Process

### 1. Identify an Area for Contribution

Before creating a proposal or implementation issue, determine:
  - The political need being addressed
  - The appropriate security classification
  - The relevant committee for review

### 2. Create an Issue

Use the appropriate issue template:
  - **Proposal**: For new ideas requiring discussion
  - **Implementation**: For executing approved proposals
  - **Documentation**: For improvements to existing documentation
  - **Criticism**: For constructive criticism of existing work

### 3. Branch Creation

Branches follow our naming conventions:
  - `proposal/[issue-topic]`: For proposal development
  - `implement/[issue-topic]`: For implementation work
  - `contributor/[username]`: For personal development work

### 4. Development Work

When working on content:
- Follow our documentation standards
- Include appropriate frontmatter with security classification
- Use the established tag taxonomy
- Run linting tools before submission

### 5. Pull Request

Submit your work using the appropriate PR template:
- Link to the original issue
- Summarize the changes
- Indicate the security classification
- Request review from appropriate committee(s)

## Commit Guidelines

All commits should follow this format:
```
[TYPE]: Short summary (50 chars or less)

More detailed explanatory text, if necessary. Wrap to about 72
characters. The blank line separating the summary from the body
is critical.

Closes #123
```

Types include:
- `[DOCS]`: Documentation changes
- `[PROP]`: Proposal development
- `[IMPL]`: Implementation of approved proposal
- `[CRIT]`: Criticism or self-criticism
- `[TECH]`: Technical infrastructure changes

## Documentation Standards

All documentation must include:

1. **YAML Frontmatter**:
   ```yaml
   ---
   title: "Document Title"
   date: YYYY-MM-DD
   lastmod: YYYY-MM-DD
   draft: boolean
   security_classification: "public|candidate|cadre"
   version: "X.Y.Z"
   document_id: "DEPT-TYPE-YEARSEQ-SECURITY"
   tags:
     - type/document-type
     - security/level
     - function/area
     - status/draft
   ---
   ```

2. **Standard Headers**:
   - H1 for document title
   - H2 for major sections
   - H3 for subsections
   - Proper heading incrementing

3. **Security Markings**:
   - Each section should indicate its security level: `## Section Title (L0)`
   - Higher classification sections must come after lower ones

## Review Process

1. **Initial Review**: Technical validation of format, structure, and security
2. **Committee Review**: Evaluation by appropriate committee(s)
3. **Feedback Phase**: Contributors address feedback
4. **Approval**: Formal acceptance through committee decision
5. **Implementation**: Merging into appropriate branch

Reviewers will check for:
- Political alignment with organizational principles
- Technical correctness and standards compliance
- Security classification appropriateness
- Documentation quality and completeness

## Code of Conduct

All contributors are expected to follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), which emphasizes:
- Comradely behavior
- Constructive criticism
- Solidarity with all oppressed peoples
- No tolerance for oppressive behavior

## ðŸŽ¯ What We Need

### High Priority Contributions
1. Documentation improvements
2. Test coverage increases
3. Accessibility enhancements
4. Security reviews
5. Template development

### Good First Issues
Look for issues labeled `good-first-issue` or `help-wanted`
