# Contributing to DRUIDS

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Distributed, Reproducible, Unifying, Ideological Documentation System (DRUIDS) for the Kansas Socialist Book Club (KSBC). Your participation is valuable to the success of this project.

## General Contribution Workflow

We follow a standard GitHub flow for contributions:

1.  **Fork the Repository:** Create your own fork of the main DRUIDS repository.
2.  **Create a Branch:** For any new feature, bug fix, or documentation change, create a new branch in your fork, usually from the `main` branch.
    - Branch naming convention: `feature/your-feature-name`, `fix/bug-description`, `docs/topic-update`.
3.  **Make Your Changes:** Implement your changes, write code, or update documentation.
    - Ensure your work aligns with the project's goals and coding/style guidelines (to be documented).
4.  **Commit Your Changes:** Write clear, concise commit messages. We encourage signing your commits.
    - Example commit message: `feat: Add initial structure for L0 content`
5.  **Push to Your Fork:** Push your branch to your forked repository.
6.  **Open a Pull Request (PR):**
    - Navigate to the main DRUIDS repository and open a Pull Request from your branch to the `main` branch of the DRUIDS repository.
    - Fill out the PR template with details about your changes.
    - Ensure your PR references any relevant issues (e.g., "Fixes #123" or "Implements #456").

## Democratic Centralist Contribution Workflow

Beyond the standard GitHub flow, DRUIDS adheres to specific democratic centralist principles in its development and contribution process.

**[Placeholder: Detailed Democratic Centralist Workflow]**

*(This section will be expanded with specific details on how democratic centralist principles (e.g., Theory -> Plan -> Practice -> Summation, criticism/self-criticism, collective decision-making on significant changes) are implemented in the DRUIDS contribution process. This may include:
- How proposals for major changes are discussed and approved.
- The role of different member tiers (if applicable to contribution rights).
- Processes for review and summation of contributions from an ideological and practical standpoint.
- How feedback and criticism are integrated into the development cycle.)*

For now, please ensure that your contributions are well-motivated and clearly explained in your Pull Request descriptions, considering their potential impact on the project's goals and usability.

## Setting up Your Development Environment

**[Placeholder: Development Environment Setup]**

*(This section will include specific instructions for setting up a local development environment, including any necessary tools, Obsidian configuration, or scripts. Refer to `OBSIDIAN_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` for initial Obsidian setup.)*

## Code of Conduct

All contributors are expected to adhere to the KSBC Code of Conduct.

**[Placeholder: Link to or text of Code of Conduct]**
*(Ensure a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` file is created or link to an existing one.)*

## Questions?

If you have questions about contributing, please:
- Check existing issues and discussions.
- Ask in the project's designated communication channels (see `README.md`).
