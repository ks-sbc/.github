# Security Policy

## Security Classification System

The KSBC implements a three-tier security classification system:

### 1. Public (L0)
- **Description**: Educational materials and general resources intended for public distribution
- **Handling**: May be freely shared but should be reviewed before publication
- **Repository Location**: `public/` directories

### 2. Candidate (L1)
- **Description**: Development and training materials for potential cadre members
- **Handling**: Distribution limited to active candidates and cadre, not for public platforms

### 3. Cadre (L2)
- **Description**: Strategic and operational documentation for core organizational work
- **Handling**: Strict need-to-know basis, secure storage required

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security issue related to repository access, content classification, or technical vulnerabilities:

1. **Do not** disclose the issue publicly
2. Submit a security report using the security report template
3. Do not include sensitive details in the initial report
4. You will receive instructions for secure communication

## Access Control

Access to repositories is strictly controlled according to security classification:
- Public repositories are visible to all
- Candidate repositories require specific access
- Cadre repositories implement strict need-to-know access controls

## Security Practices

All members are required to follow these security practices:
- Regular device security audits
- Strong password management
- Secure communication channels
- Proper metadata handling
- Content classification awareness
