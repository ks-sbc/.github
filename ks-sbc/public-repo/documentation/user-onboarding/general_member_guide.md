# General Member Guide to DRUIDS

Welcome to DRUIDS! This guide builds upon the "Beginner's Guide" and provides more specific information for General Members of KSBC.

## What is DRUIDS? (A Quick Recap)

DRUIDS (Democratic Repository and Universal Information Distribution System) is our central online platform for information, communication, and decision-making within KSBC. It helps us stay organized and work together effectively, supporting our democratic centralist principles.

## Your Role as a General Member

As a General Member, your primary interaction with DRUIDS will often involve accessing information, staying updated, and potentially participating in discussions or providing feedback when requested.

## Finding Information Relevant to You

DRUIDS is your go-to place for important materials and announcements. Hereâ€™s how you can find what you need:

*   **L0 Materials (Foundational Knowledge):** These are essential documents and resources that form the basis of our understanding and work in KSBC.
    *   **How to find them:** Look for a section typically labeled "Documents," "Resources," "Library," or specifically "L0 Materials." Within this section, materials might be organized into folders or categories.
    *   **Example:** You might find foundational texts, introductory guides, or core principles documents here.

*   **Public Announcements:** These are official communications from KSBC leadership or relevant committees.
    *   **How to find them:** There's usually a dedicated "Announcements," "News," or "Updates" section, often visible on your main dashboard or in a prominent menu location.
    *   **Action:** Regularly check this section to stay informed about important developments, upcoming events, or calls to action.

*   **General Search:** Don't forget to use the search bar! If you're looking for something specific, typing keywords into the search bar (usually found at the top of the page) can quickly lead you to the right document or information page.

## Typical Interactions and Workflows

Beyond just finding information, here are some ways you might use DRUIDS:

*   **Accessing Study Materials:** If KSBC provides specific study materials for courses, workshops, or general development, DRUIDS will be the repository for these.
    *   **Workflow:** You would navigate to the relevant section (e.g., "Study Materials," "Courses," or a specific group/committee area), find the material you need, and then you can usually download it or view it directly in your browser.
    *   **Input/Choice:** You will need to select the correct course or material you wish to access.

*   **Participating in Discussions (if facilitated through DRUIDS):** Some discussions might take place on forums or discussion boards within DRUIDS.
    *   **Workflow:**
        1.  Navigate to the "Discussions" or "Forums" section.
        2.  Browse the list of topics.
        3.  Click on a topic to read the existing posts.
        4.  If you want to contribute, look for a "Reply," "Add Comment," or "New Post" button.
    *   **Input/Choice:** You will need to type your comment or post into a text box. You'll also choose which discussion topic to participate in. Always ensure your contributions are respectful and constructive.

*   **Viewing Proposals and Decisions:** Transparency is key in KSBC. You can often view proposals that have been submitted and the outcomes of decisions made.
    *   **How to find them:** Look for sections like "Proposals," "Voting Records," or "Decisions."
    *   **Note:** As a General Member, your ability to *submit* proposals or *vote* might be defined by specific KSBC roles or processes, which would be outlined elsewhere. This guide focuses on access and viewing.

*   **Updating Your Profile:** It's important to keep your information up-to-date.
    *   **Workflow:** Find a link to "My Profile," "Account Settings," or similar (often under your name or a user icon).
    *   **Input/Choice:** You may be able to update your contact details, password, or other personal preferences. **Remember to keep your login credentials (username and password) secure and do not share them.**

## Getting Help

As mentioned in the Beginner's Guide:

*   Ask a colleague or mentor.
*   Look for a "Help" or "FAQ" section within DRUIDS.
*   Contact the designated DRUIDS support person or team if you encounter technical issues.
