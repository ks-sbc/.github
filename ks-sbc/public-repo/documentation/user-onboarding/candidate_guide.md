# Candidate Guide to DRUIDS

This guide is specifically for KSBC members who are Candidates. It builds upon the general understanding of DRUIDS and focuses on functionalities and information relevant to your role and responsibilities.

## Recap: What is DRUIDS?

DRUIDS (Democratic Repository and Universal Information Distribution System) is KSBC's central platform for information management, communication, and supporting our democratic centralist operational model.

## Your Role as a Candidate

As a Candidate, you have a more involved role within KSBC, and your interaction with DRUIDS will reflect this. You'll be accessing more specific information and may have responsibilities related to documentation and potentially some administrative tasks, depending on KSBC's current operational procedures managed through DRUIDS.

## Accessing L1 Security Tier Materials

A key part of your role as a Candidate involves engaging with L1 security tier materials. These materials contain more detailed information crucial for your development and responsibilities within KSBC.

*   **What are L1 Materials?** L1 materials go beyond the foundational (L0) information and delve into more specific operational details, internal policies, advanced concepts, or committee-specific information relevant to Candidates.
*   **How to Access L1 Materials:**
    1.  **Permissions:** Access to L1 materials is typically restricted. Your Candidate status should grant you the necessary permissions. If you believe you cannot access something you should be able to, contact your mentor or the DRUIDS administrator.
    2.  **Navigation:** L1 materials might be located in:
        *   Specific folders within the main "Documents" or "Library" section, possibly labeled "L1 Documents," "Candidate Resources," or by specific committee names.
        *   Dedicated sections or groups within DRUIDS that are only visible to members with appropriate permissions.
    *   **Path Example (Illustrative):** You might find materials under a path like `Documents/L1_Materials/Internal_Policies/` or `Groups/Candidate_Working_Group/Documentation/`. The exact path will depend on the DRUIDS structure.
*   **Responsibility:** You are expected to familiarize yourself with relevant L1 materials as part of your candidacy. Treat this information with appropriate confidentiality.

## Potential Administrative Functions and Responsibilities

Depending on how KSBC utilizes DRUIDS and your specific responsibilities as a Candidate, you might be involved in:

*   **Managing Membership Records (if applicable and stored in DRUIDS):**
    *   **Scenario:** In some cases, Candidates might assist with maintaining up-to-date records of members, especially within specific working groups or committees.
    *   **Workflow:**
        1.  Navigate to the membership management section (e.g., "Member Directory," "User Management" - access will be permission-based).
        2.  You might be able to view records. If you have edit permissions, you might update contact information, status, or other relevant fields.
    *   **Input/Choice:** This would involve **data entry**. For example, if a member changes their contact email, you would navigate to their record, find the email field, and **input** the new email address. Always ensure accuracy and follow any data privacy guidelines provided by KSBC.
    *   **Caution:** Any administrative function involving member data requires careful attention to detail and adherence to KSBC policies.

*   **Document Contribution or Management:**
    *   **Scenario:** You might be tasked with drafting new documents, revising existing ones, or organizing files within a specific area of DRUIDS.
    *   **Workflow:**
        1.  Navigate to the correct folder or document library.
        2.  To create a new document, look for an "Upload File" or "Create Document" option. You might draft the document offline and then upload it, or DRUIDS might have a built-in editor.
        3.  To edit an existing document (if you have permissions), you might "check out" the document, make changes, and then "check it in" or "save" it.
    *   **Input/Choice:** This involves creating content, naming files appropriately, choosing correct folder locations, and writing descriptive summaries if required. For example, when uploading a meeting minutes document, you would **input** a filename like `YYYY-MM-DD_CommitteeName_Meeting_Minutes.pdf`.

## Specific Workflows and Documentation Practices for Candidates

*   **Reporting and Record Keeping:** Candidates may be required to document their activities, research findings, or project progress within DRUIDS.
    *   **Workflow:** This could involve creating regular reports and uploading them to a designated folder, or updating a shared document or task list.
    *   **Example:** If you are working on a research task, you might create a document named `Candidate_YourName_Research_Topic_Report_YYYY-MM-DD.docx` and upload it to `Candidates/YourName/Reports/`.
    *   **Input/Choice:** You will be responsible for creating the content of these reports, adhering to any specified templates or formats, and ensuring they are stored in the correct location.

*   **Utilizing Collaboration Tools:** If DRUIDS includes features like task management, wikis, or shared calendars, you will be expected to use these tools as directed to coordinate with other members or manage your responsibilities.
    *   **Input/Choice:** This could involve updating task statuses, adding comments, scheduling events, or contributing to shared knowledge bases. For example, marking a task as "Complete" or **inputting** details about your progress.

## Key Reminders

*   **Permissions:** Your access to different parts of DRUIDS is governed by your role as a Candidate.
*   **Confidentiality:** L1 materials and other internal KSBC information should be handled with discretion.
*   **Accuracy:** If your role involves any data entry or record-keeping, strive for accuracy and follow established procedures.
*   **Seek Clarification:** The role of a Candidate is a learning process. If you are unsure how to perform a task in DRUIDS or what your responsibilities are, ask your mentor or a designated KSBC leader.
