## 1. Introduction

DRUIDS (Democratic Repository and Universal Information Distribution System) is a critical information and collaboration asset for KSBC. To ensure its continued effectiveness, security, and usability over time, proactive long-term maintenance and succession planning are essential. This document outlines the framework for these activities.

The purpose of this planning is to:
*   Ensure DRUIDS remains a reliable and secure platform for KSBC operations.
*   Prevent knowledge silos related to DRUIDS administration and maintenance.
*   Facilitate smooth transitions when members in key DRUIDS-related roles change.
*   Ensure DRUIDS continues to meet the evolving needs of KSBC.

## 2. Ongoing DRUIDS Maintenance Responsibilities (Summary)

Consistent maintenance is key to a healthy DRUIDS environment. Key recurring activities include:

*   **Plugin Updates and Compatibility Testing:** Regularly updating Obsidian plugins and testing for compatibility to ensure security and functionality. (See `[[plugin_update_procedures.md]]`)
*   **Backup and Restoration:** Ensuring regular backups of the DRUIDS vault (content and configuration) are performed and that restoration procedures are viable. (See `[[backup_and_restoration_procedures.md]]`)
*   **Security Audits:** Conducting periodic security audits to identify and mitigate risks, and ensure compliance with policies. (See `[[security_audit_procedures.md]]`)
*   **System Health and Performance Monitoring:** Regularly checking system responsiveness, plugin functionality, and data integrity. (See `[[system_health_and_performance_monitoring.md]]`)

**Responsibility:** These tasks should ideally be assigned to a designated DRUIDS Administration Team or a Technical Working Group within KSBC. Clear roles and responsibilities within this team should be established.

## 3. Knowledge Management and Documentation

Comprehensive and up-to-date documentation is vital for long-term maintainability.

*   **Keeping DRUIDS Documentation Current:**
    *   All user guides (Beginner's, General Member, Candidate, Cadre), workflow tutorials, maintenance procedures, and testing documents must be reviewed and updated regularly (e.g., annually or when significant changes occur).
    *   This includes ensuring links within documentation remain valid.
*   **Training Vault and Materials:**
    *   The `ks-sbc/public-repo/training-vault/` should be periodically reviewed and updated to reflect the current state of DRUIDS and best practices.
    *   New exercises or examples should be added as DRUIDS evolves.
*   **Critical Knowledge Storage:**
    *   Decisions regarding DRUIDS architecture, significant configuration changes, and the rationale behind them should be documented. This might be in dedicated L2 "System Administration" notes within DRUIDS itself, or in a secure section of the GitHub repository's wiki/documentation if appropriate.
    *   Ensure that access credentials or configurations not suitable for general documentation (e.g., specific API keys if ever used, sensitive server details if applicable in future iterations) are stored securely according to KSBC security policy, with access limited to authorized Cadre members.

## 4. Technical Skill Development within KSBC

To ensure DRUIDS can be supported long-term, KSBC should encourage skill development among its members.

*   **Encourage Learning:** Promote learning of skills relevant to DRUIDS, such as:
    *   Obsidian usage (beyond basic note-taking).
    *   Markdown syntax.
    *   Basic Git principles and commands (especially for those contributing heavily or involved in maintenance).
    *   Fundamentals of GPG encryption (for Cadre and relevant Candidates).
    *   General security awareness.
*   **Knowledge Sharing:** Encourage members who are proficient in DRUIDS to share their knowledge through informal workshops, mentoring, or by contributing to the training vault and documentation.
*   **Redundancy:** Aim to have at least two or three members familiar with the administrative and maintenance aspects of DRUIDS to avoid single points of failure.

## 5. Succession Planning for Key DRUIDS Roles

Transitions in key roles are inevitable. Planning for them ensures continuity.

*   **Identify Key Roles:**
    *   **DRUIDS Administrator(s):** Overall system oversight, plugin management, user support, configuration changes.
    *   **Security Lead(s) for DRUIDS:** Overseeing security audits, incident response, GPG key management policies.
    *   **Documentation Maintainer(s):** Ensuring user guides and technical documentation are up-to-date.
    *   **GitHub Repository Maintainer(s):** Managing repository settings, branch policies, and Actions workflows.
*   **Procedures for Knowledge Transfer:**
    *   **Mentorship:** When a role transition is anticipated, the outgoing member should mentor their successor.
    *   **Shadowing:** Allow the incoming person to shadow the current role-holder for a period.
    *   **Documented Handovers:** Create a checklist or document specific to the role, outlining key responsibilities, access credentials/locations (securely handled), common tasks, and ongoing projects. This should be reviewed and signed off by both parties.
*   **Secure Transfer of Critical Access:**
    *   Procedures must be in place for the secure transfer of any master access credentials (e.g., to GitHub organization settings, domain registrar if applicable, any master GPG keys if centrally held â€“ though individual key management is preferred). This process must be overseen by trusted Cadre members.
    *   For hardware tokens, ensure procedures for transferring responsibility or re-issuing tokens are clear.

## 6. Periodic Review of DRUIDS Relevance and Technology

Technology and organizational needs change over time.

*   **Scheduled Reviews:** Conduct a formal review of DRUIDS (e.g., annually or bi-annually) involving representatives from all user groups.
*   **Assessment Criteria:**
    *   Does DRUIDS still effectively meet KSBC's information management and collaboration needs?
    *   Are the underlying technologies (Obsidian, specific critical plugins, GitHub, Quartz for publication) still viable, well-supported, and secure?
    *   Are there emerging needs that DRUIDS currently doesn't address?
    *   What is the user satisfaction level?
*   **Proposing and Deciding on Major Changes:**
    *   Establish a process for members to propose significant upgrades, new core plugins, or even alternative system considerations.
    *   Decisions on major changes should follow KSBC's democratic decision-making processes, involving relevant stakeholders and technical advisors.

## 7. Archiving and Data Retention

*   **KSBC Data Retention Policy:** DRUIDS archiving practices should align with KSBC's overall data retention policies (which should be defined separately).
*   **Considerations:**
    *   Define how long different types of information (e.g., L0, L1, L2 documents, project records, meeting minutes) should be actively maintained within DRUIDS versus archived.
    *   Establish procedures for securely archiving parts of the vault if necessary (e.g., very old projects). This might involve creating separate, read-only archive vaults or exporting data in standard formats.
    *   Ensure archived data remains accessible if needed for historical or legal reasons, respecting its original security classification.

## 8. Budget and Resource Allocation (Considerations)

While DRUIDS is currently based on largely free and open-source tools, future needs may involve costs.

*   **Potential Future Costs:**
    *   Paid Obsidian services (e.g., Sync, Publish) if KSBC chooses to use them.
    *   Subscription costs for specialized plugins if free alternatives are insufficient.
    *   Costs for dedicated backup solutions or secure cloud storage.
    *   Training costs for specialized skills.
*   **Planning:** These potential costs should be considered in KSBC's overall budgeting process if DRUIDS is to be sustained and enhanced effectively.

By proactively addressing these long-term maintenance and succession planning aspects, KSBC can ensure DRUIDS remains a valuable and resilient asset for the organization for years to come. This is a living document and should be reviewed and updated as KSBC and DRUIDS evolve.
