## 1. Introduction and Purpose

This document outlines the procedures for responding to security incidents or breaches related to the DRUIDS (Democratic Repository and Universal Information Distribution System). A timely and effective response is crucial to minimize damage, restore normal operations, and prevent future occurrences. These procedures are designed to provide clear, actionable steps for all KSBC members.

The purpose of these procedures is to:
*   Ensure a rapid, coordinated, and effective response to security incidents.
*   Minimize the impact of security incidents on KSBC operations, data, and members.
*   Preserve evidence for investigation and potential remediation.
*   Facilitate learning from incidents to improve overall security posture.

## 2. What Constitutes a Security Incident?

In the context of DRUIDS, a security incident includes, but is not limited to:

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Any suspected or confirmed unauthorized access to L1 or L2 classified data, or to restricted areas of the DRUIDS vault or its underlying infrastructure (e.g., GitHub repositories).
*   **Data Leakage/Exposure:** Accidental or malicious disclosure of sensitive (L1/L2) information to unauthorized individuals or public forums.
*   **Compromised Credentials:** Suspected or confirmed compromise of user accounts with access to DRUIDS (e.g., Obsidian Sync accounts if used, GitHub accounts, GPG key passphrases).
*   **Compromised Hardware Token:** Loss, theft, or suspected compromise of a hardware token used for DRUIDS access or GPG key storage.
*   **Malware Infection:** Presence of malware on a system used to access DRUIDS, potentially compromising vault data or system integrity.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Any attack that renders DRUIDS or its critical components inaccessible to authorized users.
*   **Significant Data Corruption or Loss:** Unexplained loss or corruption of data within DRUIDS not attributable to normal user error.
*   **Misuse of DRUIDS:** Use of the system in a way that violates KSBC policies or for malicious purposes.
*   **Repeated Failed Login Attempts:** Suspicious patterns of failed login attempts to DRUIDS-related services.

If you are unsure whether an event constitutes a security incident, it is always better to err on the side of caution and report it.

## 3. Roles and Responsibilities

*   **Incident Reporter:** Any KSBC member who suspects or discovers a security incident is responsible for reporting it immediately.
*   **Incident Response Team (IRT) / Point of Contact:** A designated group of Cadre members (or a specific security working group) responsible for:
    *   Receiving and acknowledging incident reports.
    *   Coordinating all aspects of the incident response.
    *   Leading the investigation, containment, eradication, and recovery efforts.
    *   Communicating with relevant stakeholders.
    *   Documenting the incident and response.
    *   *(The specific members of the IRT will be designated and communicated separately by KSBC leadership).*

## 4. Immediate Actions (First Response)

If you suspect or discover a security incident, take the following immediate actions:

1.  **Containment (Limit the Damage):**
    *   **If malware is suspected on your device:** Disconnect the affected device from the network (unplug Ethernet, disable Wi-Fi) to prevent further spread. Do NOT turn it off unless instructed, as this can destroy volatile evidence.
    *   **If account compromise is suspected:** Immediately attempt to change your password for the affected account(s) if possible. Notify the IRT.
    *   **If data leakage is identified (e.g., a sensitive file in an L0 folder):** Do not attempt to delete or move it yourself unless you are part of the IRT or explicitly instructed to do so. Note its location and report it.
    *   **If a hardware token is lost/stolen:** Immediately report it to the IRT.
    *   **General Principle:** Take reasonable steps to prevent further harm or data exposure without compromising evidence.

2.  **Preservation of Evidence:**
    *   **Do NOT alter the affected system or data unnecessarily.** Do not delete files, run cleanup tools, or restart systems unless instructed by the IRT, as this can destroy valuable forensic evidence.
    *   **Document Everything:**
        *   Note the exact date and time you noticed the incident.
        *   Take screenshots of any error messages, unusual activity, or relevant screens.
        *   Record the names of any files, folders, or systems involved.
        *   Note any user accounts involved or suspected.
        *   Describe the sequence of events as clearly as possible.
        *   Preserve any relevant logs if you know how to access them and can do so without altering the system state (e.g., Obsidian console logs, Git logs if relevant and accessible).

## 5. Reporting an Incident

1.  **Report IMMEDIATELY:** Time is critical. Report any suspected incident as soon as it is discovered.
2.  **To Whom:** Report directly to the designated **Incident Response Team (IRT) / Point of Contact**. Contact details for the IRT will be maintained and communicated by KSBC leadership.
3.  **Information to Include in the Initial Report:**
    *   Your name and contact information.
    *   Date and time the incident was discovered/occurred.
    *   A brief description of the incident (what happened?).
    *   Location of the incident (e.g., specific file path in DRUIDS, URL, physical location if relevant).
    *   Any systems, data, or user accounts affected or suspected to be affected.
    *   Any immediate actions you have taken.
    *   Any error messages observed.

## 6. Incident Assessment and Triage

Upon receiving an incident report, the IRT will:

1.  **Verify the Incident:** Confirm that a security incident has actually occurred.
2.  **Assess Severity and Impact:** Determine the potential impact on KSBC data, operations, members, and reputation. Consider the type and sensitivity of data involved.
3.  **Determine Scope:** Identify all affected systems, accounts, and data.
4.  **Prioritize:** Assign a priority level to the incident based on its severity and impact to guide response efforts.
5.  **Activate Response Plan:** Initiate further steps based on the nature of the incident.

## 7. Eradication and Recovery

1.  **Eradication:**
    *   Identify and eliminate the root cause of the incident (e.g., remove malware, patch vulnerabilities, disable compromised accounts, correct misconfigurations).
    *   This phase may involve detailed forensic analysis.
2.  **Recovery:**
    *   Restore affected data or systems from secure backups. Refer to the `[[backup_and_restoration_procedures.md]]` for detailed steps.
    *   Verify the integrity and security of restored systems and data before bringing them back into full operation.
    *   Change any compromised passwords or access keys.
    *   Implement preventative measures to stop the incident from recurring.

## 8. Post-Incident Analysis and Lessons Learned

After the incident is resolved and normal operations are restored:

1.  **Conduct a Post-Incident Review:** The IRT and other relevant stakeholders will review the incident and the response efforts.
2.  **Identify Root Causes:** Determine the underlying causes that allowed the incident to occur.
3.  **Document Lessons Learned:** What went well? What could have been done better? What new vulnerabilities or weaknesses were identified?
4.  **Update Procedures and Controls:**
    *   Update security policies, procedures (including this one), and configurations based on lessons learned.
    *   Identify needs for additional training or awareness programs for KSBC members.
    *   This feeds into the continuous improvement cycle, potentially informing future security audits (see `[[security_audit_procedures.md]]`).
5.  **Report:** Prepare a final incident report summarizing the event, response, findings, and recommendations.

## 9. Communication Plan (Internal/External)

The IRT will manage communications regarding security incidents.

*   **Internal Communication:**
    *   Affected users and relevant KSBC leadership will be informed on a need-to-know basis.
    *   Provide factual information about the incident (without compromising ongoing investigations), steps being taken, and any actions users need to perform.
*   **External Communication (If Necessary):**
    *   If the incident involves a breach of personal data of external parties, or has legal or regulatory implications, KSBC leadership, in consultation with legal counsel if needed, will determine the appropriate external communication strategy.
    *   All external communication regarding security incidents must be approved by KSBC leadership.

## 10. Incident Logging

The IRT will maintain a secure log of all reported security incidents. Each entry should include:

*   Date/time reported and discovered.
*   Description of the incident.
*   Reporter's name.
*   Severity assessment.
*   Actions taken during response.
*   Root cause analysis.
*   Lessons learned.
*   Resolution date and details.

This log is confidential and will be used for tracking, analysis, and improving KSBC's security posture.
