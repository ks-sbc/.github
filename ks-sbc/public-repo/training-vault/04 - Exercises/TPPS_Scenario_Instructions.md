# Exercise: Understanding the TPPS Cycle - A Practice Scenario

This exercise will guide you through a simplified "Theory -> Plan -> Practice -> Summation" (TPPS) cycle using example documents. The goal is to help you understand how documentation supports this core KSBC workflow.

## Background

The TPPS cycle is fundamental to how KSBC approaches projects and initiatives:
1.  **Theory:** Understanding the situation, research, and developing initial ideas.
2.  **Plan:** Creating actionable steps and strategies based on the theory.
3.  **Practice:** Implementing the plan.
4.  **Summation:** Reviewing the practice, learning from it, and refining the theory or future plans.

Documentation is key to each step and to linking them together.

## Your Tasks

You will find a set of example documents in the `TPPS_Scenario_Files` subfolder.

**1. Review the Example Documents (Understand the Flow):**

*   Navigate to the `04 - Exercises/TPPS_Scenario_Files/` folder.
*   Open and read the following documents **in order**:
    1.  `[[TPPS_Scenario_Files/1_Theoretical_Paper_Example.md]]`
    2.  `[[TPPS_Scenario_Files/2_Plan_Example.md]]`
    3.  `[[TPPS_Scenario_Files/3_Practice_Report_Example.md]]`
    4.  `[[TPPS_Scenario_Files/4_Summation_Example.md]]`
*   As you read, pay attention to how each document builds upon the previous one.
    *   `[SCREENSHOT: File explorer view showing the four TPPS_Scenario_Files in order.]`

**2. Identify Key Links and References:**

*   While reviewing, notice the internal links (e.g., `[[...]]`) that connect these documents.
*   **Question:** In `2_Plan_Example.md`, what specific theoretical point does it reference from `1_Theoretical_Paper_Example.md`?
*   **Question:** How does `3_Practice_Report_Example.md` relate its findings back to the `2_Plan_Example.md`?

**3. Add a New Task to the Plan:**

*   Open `[[TPPS_Scenario_Files/2_Plan_Example.md]]`.
*   This document contains a list of tasks.
*   **Your Task:** Add a new task to the "Actionable Steps (Tasks)" list. For example:
    ```markdown
    - [ ] Task 4: Draft communication materials for community outreach. (ðŸ“… YYYY-MM-DD) ðŸ”¼
    ```
    *   **Operator Input:** You will type this new task line. Remember to replace `YYYY-MM-DD` with a placeholder date.
*   Save the file (Obsidian usually auto-saves, but `Ctrl+S` or `Cmd+S` is good practice).

**4. Write a Brief "Self-Criticism" Note Related to the Summation:**

*   Imagine you were part of the team that went through this TPPS cycle. After reading the `[[TPPS_Scenario_Files/4_Summation_Example.md]]`, you have some thoughts on what could have been done better or what was missed.
*   **Your Task:**
    1.  Create a **new note** in the main `04 - Exercises/` folder. Name it `My_TPPS_Critique.md`.
        *   **Operator Input:** You will create this new file and name it.
    2.  In `My_TPPS_Critique.md`, write a brief point of self-criticism or an area for future improvement related to the scenario. For example:
        ```markdown
        # My Critique of the Community Garden TPPS

        Regarding the [[TPPS_Scenario_Files/4_Summation_Example.md|Summation Example]], I think we could have improved by:

        *   More clearly defining the success metrics in the original [[TPPS_Scenario_Files/2_Plan_Example.md|Plan Example]] to make the summation more robust.
        *   Perhaps the initial [[TPPS_Scenario_Files/1_Theoretical_Paper_Example.md|Theoretical Paper]] didn't fully account for [insert a thought here].

        #self-criticism #TPPS-reflection
        ```
        *   **Operator Input:** You will write content similar to this, making sure to link to the relevant documents.
    3.  **Link it Back:** Now, open `[[TPPS_Scenario_Files/4_Summation_Example.md]]` again. At the bottom of this file, add a link to the critique note you just created. For example:
        `See also: [[../My_TPPS_Critique.md]]`
        *   **Operator Input:** You will add this link.
    *   `[SCREENSHOT: My_TPPS_Critique.md note with example content and a link in the 4_Summation_Example.md pointing back to it.]`

## Reflection

*   How did the links between documents help you understand the flow of the TPPS cycle?
*   Can you see how this structured approach to documentation helps in organizing projects and learning from them?
*   How does adding your critique (even a small one) contribute to the idea of continuous improvement within the TPPS framework?

This scenario is simplified. In real KSBC projects, these documents would be much more detailed, involve more people, and span longer periods. However, the core principles of documenting each stage and linking them for clarity and continuity remain the same.

Well done for completing this exercise! You're getting a good grasp of how DRUIDS supports KSBC's operational methods.
