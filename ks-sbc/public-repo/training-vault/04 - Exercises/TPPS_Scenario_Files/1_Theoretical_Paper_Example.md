## 1. Introduction
This paper explores the potential for utilizing community gardens as a mechanism to increase local civic engagement and improve neighborhood cohesion.

## 2. Core Hypothesis
Increased participation in shared, tangible local projects (like a community garden) can lead to stronger social ties and a greater sense of collective efficacy among residents. This, in turn, can spur further community-led initiatives.

**Key Theoretical Point:** *Shared physical work on a common-good project builds trust and communication pathways.* (Point A)

## 3. Supporting Arguments
*   Studies on urban green spaces.
*   Examples from other communities.
*   Alignment with KSBC principles of local empowerment.

## 4. Potential Challenges
*   Securing land/resources.
*   Ensuring equitable participation.
*   Long-term maintenance.

## 5. Conclusion & Next Steps
The theoretical basis for a community garden project appears strong. Further investigation into a practical plan is warranted.
