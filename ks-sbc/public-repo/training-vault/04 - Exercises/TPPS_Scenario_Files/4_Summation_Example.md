# Summation: Community Garden Initiative - Phase 1 Review

**Date:** 2023-06-15
**Based On:** [[3_Practice_Report_Example.md]] and original [[2_Plan_Example.md]]
**Status:** Finalized Summation for Phase 1
**Tags:** #summation #community-garden #phase1 #lessons-learned

## 1. Overview of Outcomes
Phase 1 of the Community Garden Initiative has concluded. This summation reviews the practice against the initial theory and plan.

*   **KPI Achievement:**
    *   Volunteer retention was high (7/8).
    *   Initial crops were successfully planted and partly harvested (radishes).
    *   Qualitative feedback was largely positive, with actionable points for improvement.
*   The project generally followed the [[2_Plan_Example.md|original plan]], with minor deviations noted in the [[3_Practice_Report_Example.md|Practice Report]].

## 2. Learnings & Insights

*   **Confirmation of Theory (Point A):** The observation in the [[3_Practice_Report_Example.md|Practice Report]] about collaborative soil preparation fostering communication strongly supports "Point A" from the [[1_Theoretical_Paper_Example.md|Theoretical Paper]]. Shared physical work did indeed seem to build trust.
*   **Volunteer Management:** While recruitment was successful, managing ongoing engagement and communication requires a dedicated strategy.
*   **Resource Planning:** Water access needs a more permanent solution than ad-hoc arrangements. The rocky soil issue highlights the need for more thorough site assessment in future plans.
*   **Task Management:** The tasks in the plan evolved. Regular updates to the plan document would be beneficial for clarity during the practice phase.

## 3. Criticism/Self-Criticism
*   We could have involved the recruited volunteers earlier in the final site selection process to increase initial buy-in even further.
*   The initial KPIs in the [[2_Plan_Example.md|Plan]] could have been more specific regarding "qualitative feedback" collection methods.
*   *(This is where a user might link their own critique, e.g., See also: [[../My_TPPS_Critique.md]])*

## 4. Recommendations for Future Phases (or New Theory)
*   Develop a more detailed volunteer engagement plan for Phase 2.
*   Allocate budget/resources for permanent water solutions.
*   Incorporate a "Detailed Site Assessment" task into future project plans of this nature.
*   Refine the theory: "While shared physical work builds trust, sustained engagement requires clear roles, consistent communication, AND reliable infrastructure."

This summation concludes Phase 1. Any subsequent phases would start a new TPPS cycle, informed by these learnings.
