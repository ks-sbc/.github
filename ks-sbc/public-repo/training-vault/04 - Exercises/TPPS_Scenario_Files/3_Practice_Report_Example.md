**Date:** 2023-04-30
**Relates To Plan:** [[2_Plan_Example.md]]
**Status:** Interim Report
**Tags:** #practice-report #community-garden #phase1

## 1. Summary of Actions Taken
This report details the practical implementation steps based on the [[2_Plan_Example.md|Community Garden Initiative Plan - Phase 1]].

*   **Location:** The "Elm Street Vacant Lot" was secured (Task 2 completed).
*   **Volunteers:** 8 initial volunteers were recruited by March 30th (Task 3 ongoing, initial target met).
*   **Preparation & Planting:**
    *   Soil testing and basic tilling completed by April 15th.
    *   Initial planting of radishes and lettuce occurred on April 20th.

## 2. Progress Against KPIs
*   **Active Volunteers:** 7 out of 8 volunteers remained active as of April 30th. One volunteer relocated.
*   **Successful Planting:** Initial crops planted successfully. Germination observed for lettuce.
*   **Qualitative Feedback (Initial):**
    *   Volunteers expressed enthusiasm for the project.
    *   Some concerns raised about consistent water access (to be addressed).

## 3. Challenges Encountered
*   Difficulty in scheduling initial group meetings due to varied volunteer availability.
*   Unexpectedly rocky soil in one section of the lot required extra preparation time.

## 4. Observations
*   The collaborative soil preparation days seemed to foster good communication among volunteers, aligning with "Point A" from the [[1_Theoretical_Paper_Example.md]].
*   The actual tasks in the [[2_Plan_Example.md]] are being updated as work progresses.
