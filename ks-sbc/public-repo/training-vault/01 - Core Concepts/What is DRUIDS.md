# What is DRUIDS?

DRUIDS stands for Democratic Repository and Universal Information Distribution System. It is KSBC's primary system for managing documents, tracking projects, and facilitating communication, all while supporting our democratic centralist principles.

## Core Functionality (Obsidian-Based)
DRUIDS is built using Obsidian, a powerful note-taking and knowledge base application. This allows us to:
*   Create and store documents in Markdown format.
*   Link documents together to create a connected web of information (e.g., [[Understanding Security Tiers.md]]).
*   Use tags for organization (e.g., #core-concept, #documentation).
*   Utilize various plugins for enhanced functionality like Kanban boards, task management, and potentially Git integration for version control.

## Relation to Main Documentation
This training vault provides a hands-on introduction. For comprehensive information, please refer to the main DRUIDS documentation guides, such as:
*   The "Beginner's Guide to DRUIDS" (You would find this in the main DRUIDS vault under `documentation/user-onboarding/beginners_guide.md`).
*   Other guides in the `documentation/` folder of the main vault.

This note, [[../Examples/L0 - Public Examples/Example Public Document.md]], is an example of a document you might find in DRUIDS.
