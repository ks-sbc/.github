# Understanding Security Tiers in DRUIDS

DRUIDS uses a security tier system to classify information and control access. This ensures that sensitive information is protected while allowing appropriate access for different roles within KSBC.

## The Main Tiers

1.  **L0: Public / General Access**
    *   **Content:** Information suitable for all KSBC members and potentially the public (e.g., general announcements, non-sensitive guides).
    *   **Access:** Generally accessible to anyone with access to the DRUIDS vault.
    *   **Example:** [[../Examples/L0 - Public Examples/Example Public Document.md]]

2.  **L1: Internal / Candidate Access**
    *   **Content:** Internal operational information, Candidate training materials, non-public discussion drafts.
    *   **Access:** Restricted to Candidates and Cadre members. In a real DRUIDS system, these files would be in protected folders.
    *   **Example:** [[../Examples/L1 - Candidate Examples/Example Candidate Document.md]]

3.  **L2: Cadre / Sensitive Access**
    *   **Content:** Highly sensitive strategic information, core leadership discussions, security details.
    *   **Access:** Strictly limited to Cadre members, often with additional security measures like encryption. These files would be in highly secured areas of DRUIDS. *(No L2 examples are included in this public training vault for security reasons).*

## Why Tiers Matter

*   **Security:** Protects sensitive KSBC operations and member data.
*   **Need-to-Know:** Ensures members access only the information relevant to their roles and responsibilities.
*   **Democratic Centralism:** While promoting democratic discussion, centralism requires protecting decided strategies and sensitive internal matters to ensure unified and effective action.

## In Practice

*   You will learn to identify the classification of documents you are working with.
*   You must follow procedures for handling documents at each tier (storage, sharing, communication).
*   The main DRUIDS vault has specific folders for L0, L1, and L2 materials. This training vault simplifies this for learning purposes.

For detailed procedures, refer to the `security_procedures_manual.md` in the main DRUIDS documentation.
