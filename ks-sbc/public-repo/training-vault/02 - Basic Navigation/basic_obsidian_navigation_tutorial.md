# Tutorial: Basic Navigation in DRUIDS (Obsidian)

Welcome! This tutorial will guide you through the fundamental ways to navigate within the DRUIDS environment, which uses Obsidian. Let's get you moving around your vault like a pro!

Remember, this training vault is a safe space to explore.

## 1. The Obsidian Interface: An Overview

When you first open Obsidian, you'll see a few key areas:
*   **The Main Note Pane:** This is the largest area in the center where the content of your currently open note is displayed. Right now, you're reading this tutorial in the main note pane.
*   **The Left Sidebar:** This area can show different helpful views like the File Explorer, Search, and Tags.
*   **The Ribbon:** A very thin vertical bar on the far left with icons for various functions.

## 2. Managing the Left Sidebar

The left sidebar is your primary tool for browsing the file structure of your vault.

*   **File Explorer:** Shows all the folders and notes in your vault, just like a file manager on your computer.
    *   **To Open/Close File Explorer:**
        *   Look for an icon on the ribbon (far left) that looks like a folder or two documents. Clicking this toggles the File Explorer.
        *   Alternatively, use the hotkey: `Ctrl+Shift+E` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+E` (macOS).
    *   `[SCREENSHOT: Obsidian interface with the File Explorer sidebar open on the left, pointing to the toggle icon on the ribbon.]`
    *   **Practice:**
        1.  If your File Explorer isn't open, open it now.
        2.  Find and click on the `00 - Welcome and Instructions` folder.
        3.  Then click on the `START HERE.md` note to open it. You've just navigated using the File Explorer!

*   **Search:** Allows you to search for text within all notes in your vault.
    *   **To Open/Close Search:**
        *   Look for a magnifying glass icon on the ribbon.
        *   Hotkey: `Ctrl+Shift+F` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+F` (macOS).
    *   `[SCREENSHOT: Obsidian interface with the Search sidebar open, pointing to the toggle icon.]`

*   **Tags Pane:** If you use tags (like `#example` or `#core-concept`), this pane shows all your tags and lets you find notes associated with them.
    *   **To Open/Close Tags Pane:**
        *   Look for a tag icon (#) on the ribbon.
        *   Hotkey: Usually not set by default, but can be configured.
    *   `[SCREENSHOT: Obsidian interface with the Tags Pane open, pointing to the toggle icon.]`

**Question:** Open the File Explorer and find the `Examples` folder. How many sub-folders are inside `Examples`? (You should see `L0 - Public Examples` and `L1 - Candidate Examples`)

## 3. Navigating Between Notes

*   **Clicking Internal Links (Wikilinks):**
    *   You've already seen these! They look like `[[Name of Another Note]]`.
    *   When you click on an internal link, Obsidian will open that note in the main pane.
    *   **Practice:** In the `01 - Core Concepts` folder, open the `What is DRUIDS.md` note. Find the link to `[[Understanding Security Tiers.md]]` and click it.

*   **Back and Forward Navigation:**
    *   Just like in a web browser, Obsidian keeps track of the notes you've visited.
    *   Look for arrow icons, usually located at the top left of the main interface, above the note title.
        *   `←` (Back arrow): Takes you to the previously viewed note.
        *   `→` (Forward arrow): If you've gone back, this takes you forward again.
    *   `[SCREENSHOT: Top bar of Obsidian, highlighting the back and forward navigation arrows.]`
    *   **Practice:**
        1.  Click the back arrow. You should return to the `What is DRUIDS.md` note.
        2.  Click the forward arrow. You should go back to `Understanding Security Tiers.md`.

## 4. Using the Quick Switcher

The Quick Switcher is a very fast way to open any note if you know part of its name.

*   **To Open Quick Switcher:**
    *   Press `Ctrl+O` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+O` (macOS).
    *   A small search bar will appear, usually in the middle of your screen.
    *   `[SCREENSHOT: The Quick Switcher dialog box open over the Obsidian interface.]`

*   **Using It:**
    1.  Start typing the name of the note you want to open. For example, type `Example Public`.
    2.  The Quick Switcher will show a list of matching notes.
    3.  Use your arrow keys (↑ and ↓) to select the desired note from the list.
    4.  Press `Enter` to open the selected note.

*   **Practice:**
    1.  Use the Quick Switcher (`Ctrl/Cmd+O`) to open the `Example Public Document.md` note located in the `Examples/L0 - Public Examples/` folder.
    2.  **Question:** What is the first heading (after the main title) in the `Example Public Document.md` note? (Answer: "Content")
    3.  Now, use the Quick Switcher to come back to this tutorial note (`basic_obsidian_navigation_tutorial.md`).

## 5. Understanding the Graph View (A Basic Look)

The Graph View visually represents the connections (links) between your notes.

*   **To Open Graph View:**
    *   Look for an icon on the ribbon that looks like three dots connected by lines.
    *   Hotkey: `Ctrl+G` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+G` (macOS).
    *   `[SCREENSHOT: The Graph View icon on the ribbon, and a separate image of what a simple graph view might look like with a few connected notes.]`

*   **What it Represents:**
    *   Each dot (or "node") in the graph is one of your notes.
    *   Lines between the dots show that those notes are linked to each other.
    *   It can help you discover connections between topics you might not have realized were there!

*   **Interacting with it (Basics):**
    *   You can click and drag nodes around.
    *   Hovering over a node might highlight its connections.
    *   Clicking a node in the Graph View will open that note in the main pane.

*   **Practice:**
    1.  Open the Graph View.
    2.  Can you find the node for this tutorial note? How many lines are connected to it so far (based on the links you've seen or created in this vault)?
    3.  Find the node for `[[../01 - Core Concepts/What is DRUIDS.md]]` and click on it. It should open that note.
