# Welcome to the DRUIDS Training Vault!

This vault is a hands-on environment designed to help you learn the basics of using DRUIDS (which is built on Obsidian) within KSBC.

## Purpose of This Training Vault

*   **Familiarize Yourself:** Get comfortable with the Obsidian interface and basic DRUIDS workflows.
*   **Practice Key Skills:** Learn how to create notes, link documents, use tags, and understand our documentation structure without affecting the live DRUIDS production vault.
*   **Understand Core Concepts:** Reinforce your understanding of DRUIDS principles, security tiers, and best practices.

## How to Use This Vault

1.  **Explore:** Click through the folders on the left to see how content is organized.
2.  **Read the Notes:** Start with the notes in `01 - Core Concepts` to get foundational knowledge.
3.  **Examine Examples:** Look at the documents in the `Examples` folder to see how notes are formatted, linked, and tagged.
4.  **Complete Exercises:** The `04 - Exercises` folder contains tasks for you to practice. This is the best way to learn!
5.  **Experiment:** Feel free to create your own notes, try out different features, and make mistakes â€“ that's what this training vault is for! Your actions here will **not** affect the main KSBC DRUIDS vault.

## Important Notes

*   This training vault is a *simplified representation* of the main DRUIDS vault. Some advanced features or security measures (like GPG encryption or full Git integration) might not be fully active here, or will be simulated.
*   Always refer to the main DRUIDS documentation (located in the `ks-sbc/public-repo/documentation/` directory of the actual DRUIDS vault) for complete and up-to-date procedures and policies.
