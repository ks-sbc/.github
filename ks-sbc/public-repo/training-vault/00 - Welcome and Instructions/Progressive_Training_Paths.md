# DRUIDS Training Vault: Progressive Training Paths

Welcome to the DRUIDS Training Vault! To help you navigate the learning process effectively, we've outlined a couple of progressive training paths. These paths are designed to build your skills méthodically, whether you're brand new to DRUIDS and Obsidian or have some prior experience.

## How to Choose Your Path

Read the descriptions below. If you're unsure, it's generally better to start with the Beginner Path – you can always skim through familiar topics quickly.

*   **Choose the Beginner Path if:**
    *   You are new to Obsidian.
    *   You are new to writing in Markdown.
    *   You are unfamiliar with concepts like "wikilinks," "frontmatter," or "tags."
    *   You want a comprehensive introduction from the ground up.

*   **Choose the Intermediate Path if:**
    *   You are generally comfortable with Obsidian's interface and basic Markdown.
    *   You have used note-taking apps with linking features before.
    *   You are primarily interested in understanding KSBC's specific DRUIDS workflows, security practices, and how we apply democratic centralist principles in our documentation.

## Beginner Path: Mastering the Fundamentals

This path focuses on getting you comfortable with the tools and basic concepts.

**Recommended Sequence:**

1.  **Start Here:**
    *   [[START HERE.md]] - Understand the purpose and layout of this training vault.
    *   This document: [[Progressive_Training_Paths.md]] - You are here!

2.  **Core DRUIDS & Obsidian Concepts:**
    *   `[[../01 - Core Concepts/What is DRUIDS.md]]` - What DRUIDS is and its purpose in KSBC.
    *   `[[../01 - Core Concepts/Understanding Security Tiers.md]]` - A crucial concept for all KSBC work.

3.  **Basic Navigation in Obsidian:**
    *   `[[../02 - Basic Navigation/basic_obsidian_navigation_tutorial.md]]` - Learn how to move around, open notes, and use sidebars.

4.  **Working with Documents:**
    *   `[[../03 - Working with Documents/working_with_documents_tutorial.md]]` - Creating notes, folders, basic Markdown formatting, linking, and tags.

5.  **Essential Reference Cards:**
    *   Review `[[../Reference Cards/Markdown_Syntax_Quick_Reference.md]]` alongside the document tutorial.
    *   Review `[[../Reference Cards/Obsidian_Keyboard_Shortcuts_Reference.md]]` to start learning time-saving shortcuts.

6.  **Initial Practice:**
    *   `[[../04 - Exercises/Exercise - Create and Link.md]]` - Put your new skills to the test.

## Intermediate Path: Applying Skills to DRUIDS Workflows

This path is for those who know the basics of Obsidian/Markdown and want to focus on KSBC's specific application of DRUIDS.

**Recommended Sequence:**

1.  **Refresh and Orient:**
    *   [[START HERE.md]] - Quick review of the training vault's purpose.
    *   This document: [[Progressive_Training_Paths.md]] - Confirm this is the right path.
    *   Quickly skim `[[../02 - Basic Navigation/basic_obsidian_navigation_tutorial.md]]` and `[[../03 - Working with Documents/working_with_documents_tutorial.md]]` to ensure you're comfortable with all topics. Pay attention to any DRUIDS-specific callouts.
    *   Review `[[../Reference Cards/Obsidian_Keyboard_Shortcuts_Reference.md]]` for efficiency.

2.  **Deep Dive into Core DRUIDS Concepts & Practices:**
    *   `[[../01 - Core Concepts/What is DRUIDS.md]]`
    *   `[[../01 - Core Concepts/Understanding Security Tiers.md]]` - Ensure full comprehension.

3.  **Understanding KSBC Workflows:**
    *   Thoroughly engage with the `[[../04 - Exercises/TPPS_Scenario_Instructions.md]]` and all linked files (`1_Theoretical_Paper_Example.md`, etc.). This is a key practical example.
        *   Complete all tasks in the scenario instructions, including creating `My_TPPS_Critique.md`.

4.  **Connecting to Broader KSBC Principles:**
    *   After completing the TPPS scenario, read the following from the main DRUIDS documentation (you'll find these in the *actual* DRUIDS vault, but they are listed here for context):
        *   `documentation/user-onboarding/democratic_centralist_documentation_best_practices.md` - Understand how our documentation supports our principles.
        *   `documentation/user-onboarding/security_procedures_manual.md` - Crucial for understanding how to handle information correctly.

5.  **Self-Assessment & Further Practice:**
    *   `[[../04 - Exercises/Basic_Skills_Self_Assessment_Quiz.md]]` - Use this to confirm your grasp of essential operations.
    *   Explore the `Examples/` folder more deeply, particularly the notes in `[[../Examples/L1 - Candidate Examples/]]` understanding their context.

## Integrating with Role-Specific Guides

This training vault provides foundational and general DRUIDS skills. The main DRUIDS documentation (in the `ks-sbc/public-repo/documentation/user-onboarding/` directory of the live vault) contains role-specific guides:

*   `beginners_guide.md` (A more general overview)
*   `general_member_guide.md`
*   `candidate_guide.md`
*   `cadre_guide.md`

**Approach:**

1.  **Complete Your Chosen Path Here:** Gain the practical Obsidian skills and understanding of DRUIDS structure from this training vault first.
2.  **Read Your Role-Specific Guide:** Once comfortable with the training vault material, read the guide from the main documentation that corresponds to your role in KSBC (General Member, Candidate, Cadre).
3.  **Connect the Dots:** Your role-specific guide will describe responsibilities and information access relevant to your position. Your training here will have equipped you with the *how-to* for navigating DRUIDS, finding documents, understanding security, and recognizing workflow patterns mentioned in your role guide.

For example, when your `candidate_guide.md` mentions accessing "L1 materials," your experience with "Understanding Security Tiers" and navigating folders in this training vault will make that instruction clear.

Continuous learning is encouraged. Revisit these training materials as needed, and always refer to the main DRUIDS documentation for the most current official procedures.
