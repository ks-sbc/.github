# Example Candidate Document (L1)

This is an example of an L1 (Internal/Candidate Access) document.

**Note:** In a real DRUIDS environment, this document would be located in an L1-restricted folder. Access would be limited to Candidates and Cadre members. For training purposes, it's included here.

## Content
Information here would be for internal KSBC use, relevant for Candidates and Cadre. This might include:
*   Internal operational guidelines.
*   Candidate-specific training materials.
*   Drafts of documents not yet ready for wider internal viewing.

## Metadata (Illustrative Frontmatter)

This document might discuss internal procedures or link to other L1 materials. For instance, it could reference details in [[../../01 - Core Concepts/Understanding Security Tiers.md]].

**Security Note:** Handling L1 information requires adherence to specific security procedures outlined in the main DRUIDS `security_procedures_manual.md`. This includes not sharing it outside authorized groups. In a live environment, this file might be subject to different access controls or even encryption if deemed necessary.
