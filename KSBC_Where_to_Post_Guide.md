### 📚 Educational content, reading, or the website?
➡️ **Go to `site` Discussions**

## 📝 Examples to Make it Clear

| I want to... | Where to go | Why |
|-------------|------------|-----|
| Suggest we read a new book | `site` Discussions | It's educational content |
| Propose changing meeting times | `.github` Discussions | It's about organization |
| Share an article I wrote | `site` Discussions | It's content for the website |
| Ask how to use GitHub | `.github` Discussions | It's technical/organizational help |

## 🎯 Still Unsure?

**When in doubt, ask yourself:**
