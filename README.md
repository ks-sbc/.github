# DRUIDS - Distributed, Reproducible, Unifying, Ideological Documentation System

## Introduction

Welcome to the official repository for the DRUIDS project of the Kansas Socialist Book Club (KSBC).

**[Placeholder: KSBC Organizational Context]**
*(Briefly describe the KSBC, its mission, and the role of DRUIDS within it. This section will be expanded later with more specific details provided by the KSBC team.)*

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository houses the core components of the DRUIDS system, including:
- Obsidian vault configurations and content structure.
- Documentation templates and content.
- Workflow automation scripts.
- Guidelines for content creation, security, and collaboration.

The aim is to provide a secure, efficient, and ideologically coherent system for managing the KSBC's collective knowledge and operational documentation.

## Democratic Centralist Principles in DRUIDS

The DRUIDS system is designed to embody and support the democratic centralist principles of the KSBC.

**[Placeholder: Overview of Democratic Centralist Principles in DRUIDS]**
*(This section will detail how DRUIDS workflows, security measures, and collaborative tools are intended to support principles such as political unity, cadre development, criticism/self-criticism, and the Theory -> Plan -> Practice -> Summation cycle. Specific examples related to DRUIDS features will be added here.)*

## Repository Structure Overview

- **/content**: Contains the main documentation and content, organized by security tiers:
    - `content/L0_public/`: Publicly accessible materials.
    - `content/L1_candidate/`: Materials for candidates and administrative functions.
    - `content/L2_cadre/`: Restricted materials for cadre members.
- **/.github**: Contains issue templates, pull request templates, and (eventually) GitHub Actions workflows.
- **/.obsidian**: (To be created) Will contain Obsidian-specific configuration files for vault setup, plugins, themes, etc.
- **/templates**: (To be created) Will house document templates for use with Obsidian's Templater plugin.
- `OBSIDIAN_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`: Comprehensive guide for setting up and using Obsidian with this system.
