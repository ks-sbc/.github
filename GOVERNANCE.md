# KSBC Governance Model

## Democratic Centralist Structure

The Kansas Socialist Book Club operates on democratic centralist principles, which include:

1. **Democratic Discussion**: All members can participate in open discussion on proposals
2. **Centralized Decision-Making**: Once decisions are made through democratic processes, they are binding on all members
3. **Hierarchical Accountability**: Committees are accountable to the membership and report regularly on their activities
4. **Collective Implementation**: All members unite around implementing decided actions regardless of their position in discussions

## Organizational Structure

### Committees
- **Education Committee**: Responsible for educational materials and study programs
- **Technical Committee**: Manages technical infrastructure and documentation systems
- **Outreach Committee**: Coordinates community engagement and recruitment
- **Security Committee**: Oversees information security and classification

### Decision Flow
1. **Proposal Phase**: Issues are created for discussion
2. **Discussion Phase**: Democratic input is gathered
3. **Decision Phase**: Relevant committee makes decision
4. **Implementation Phase**: Unified action on decided proposals

## Security Classification

Our documentation system uses a three-tier security model:
1. **Public**: Educational materials and resources for public consumption
2. **Candidate**: Development materials for potential cadre members
3. **Cadre**: Strategic and operational documentation for core members

## Criticism & Self-Criticism

We implement regular criticism and self-criticism sessions to improve our work:
1. Individual reflection on contributions and shortcomings
2. Collective assessment of organizational practices
3. Concrete commitments for improvement
4. Documentation and tracking of progress

## Mass Line Implementation

We follow the mass line method of "from the masses, to the masses":
1. Collecting experiences and needs from the masses
2. Analyzing and synthesizing these experiences through theory
3. Returning this knowledge to the masses in the form of political education
