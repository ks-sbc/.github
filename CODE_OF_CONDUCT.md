## Democratic Centralist Process

### Addressing Violations

Our approach to Code of Conduct violations follows democratic centralist principles:

3. **Discussion**: Democratic discussion of the issue within appropriate bodies
4. **Decision**: Clear decision on necessary actions
5. **Implementation**: Unified implementation of decided actions
6. **Review**: Critical evaluation of the response and outcomes

### Response Actions

Responses to violations may include:
- Comradely correction
- Formal criticism
- Educational requirements
- Temporary removal from specific roles
- Suspension of specific privileges
- Removal from the organization in serious cases

All actions aim primarily at political development and organizational improvement rather than punishment.

## Criticism and Self-Criticism

We implement regular criticism and self-criticism sessions to:
- Identify and address contradictions within our work
- Promote political development of all members

All members are expected to participate in these sessions with honesty, humility, and a commitment to improvement.
