# MetaEdit

## Purpose

MetaEdit facilitates easy editing of YAML frontmatter and Dataview inline fields. For DRUIDS, this is useful for managing metadata consistently, ensuring documents have correct security classifications, status updates, and other key fields required for Dataview queries and organizational tracking.

## Installation Steps

1.  Navigate to Settings (gear icon) > Community Plugins.
2.  If community plugins are not yet enabled, click "Turn on community plugins" (and accept any warning).
3.  Click "Browse" to open the community plugins modal.
4.  In the search bar, type "MetaEdit".
5.  Find the "MetaEdit" plugin in the search results and click on it.
6.  Click the "Install" button.
7.  Once installed, click the "Enable" button.
8.  Close the community plugins modal.

## Configuration

Plugin settings can usually be found under Settings > Community Plugins > MetaEdit or in its own dedicated section in the Settings sidebar (often labeled "MetaEdit").

Detailed configuration for DRUIDS-specific use cases (e.g., specific fields to manage, API integration if used) is a separate task and will be documented elsewhere.
