# Custom CSS

## Purpose

The Custom CSS plugin allows you to load a custom `obsidian.css` file, giving you greater control over the appearance of your Obsidian vault beyond theme settings and snippets. For DRUIDS, this can be used for more in-depth visual customizations, potentially including specific styling for security tiers or other organizational branding, if snippets are insufficient.

## Installation Steps

1.  Navigate to Settings (gear icon) > Community Plugins.
2.  If community plugins are not yet enabled, click "Turn on community plugins" (and accept any warning).
3.  Click "Browse" to open the community plugins modal.
4.  In the search bar, type "Custom CSS".
5.  Find the "Custom CSS" plugin in the search results (usually by AllowZ) and click on it.
6.  Click the "Install" button.
7.  Once installed, click the "Enable" button.
8.  Close the community plugins modal.

## Configuration

Plugin settings can usually be found under Settings > Community Plugins > Custom CSS or in its own dedicated section in the Settings sidebar (often labeled "Custom CSS").

The primary configuration involves creating a `obsidian.css` file in your vault's root directory (`.obsidian/obsidian.css` or a custom path specified in the plugin settings). DRUIDS-specific CSS rules are a separate task and will be documented elsewhere.
