# TagFolder

## Purpose

TagFolder allows you to browse your notes in a folder-like structure based on their tags. This offers an alternative way to navigate and organize content. For DRUIDS, it can be particularly useful for organizing content by security tiers (if tags are used for this), thematic categories, or project labels, complementing the physical folder structure.

## Installation Steps

1.  Navigate to Settings (gear icon) > Community Plugins.
2.  If community plugins are not yet enabled, click "Turn on community plugins" (and accept any warning).
3.  Click "Browse" to open the community plugins modal.
4.  In the search bar, type "TagFolder".
5.  Find the "TagFolder" plugin in the search results and click on it.
6.  Click the "Install" button.
7.  Once installed, click the "Enable" button.
8.  Close the community plugins modal.

## Configuration

Plugin settings can usually be found under Settings > Community Plugins > TagFolder or in its own dedicated section in the Settings sidebar (often labeled "TagFolder").

Detailed configuration for DRUIDS-specific use cases (e.g., tag hierarchies, display options) is a separate task and will be documented elsewhere.
