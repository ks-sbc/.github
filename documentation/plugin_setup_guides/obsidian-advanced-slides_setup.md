# Advanced Slides

## Purpose

Advanced Slides allows you to create Reveal.js presentations directly from Markdown notes in Obsidian. This is valuable for DRUIDS for creating educational materials, presenting political analyses, training sessions, and any form of knowledge sharing that benefits from a slideshow format.

## Installation Steps

1.  Navigate to Settings (gear icon) > Community Plugins.
2.  If community plugins are not yet enabled, click "Turn on community plugins" (and accept any warning).
3.  Click "Browse" to open the community plugins modal.
4.  In the search bar, type "Advanced Slides".
5.  Find the "Advanced Slides" plugin in the search results and click on it.
6.  Click the "Install" button.
7.  Once installed, click the "Enable" button.
8.  Close the community plugins modal.

## Configuration

Plugin settings can usually be found under Settings > Community Plugins > Advanced Slides or in its own dedicated section in the Settings sidebar (often labeled "Advanced Slides").

Detailed configuration for DRUIDS-specific use cases (e.g., slide templates, presentation themes) is a separate task and will be documented elsewhere.
