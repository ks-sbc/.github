# Notion-Like Tables

## Purpose

This plugin provides a more user-friendly and powerful way to create and manage Markdown tables, similar to Notion's table experience. In DRUIDS, it can be used for structured data entry in notes, creating comparison tables, or any situation where a more robust table editor is beneficial.

## Installation Steps

1.  Navigate to Settings (gear icon) > Community Plugins.
2.  If community plugins are not yet enabled, click "Turn on community plugins" (and accept any warning).
3.  Click "Browse" to open the community plugins modal.
4.  In the search bar, type "Notion-Like Tables".
5.  Find the "Notion-Like Tables" plugin in the search results and click on it.
6.  Click the "Install" button.
7.  Once installed, click the "Enable" button.
8.  Close the community plugins modal.

## Configuration

Plugin settings can usually be found under Settings > Community Plugins > Notion-Like Tables or in its own dedicated section in the Settings sidebar (often labeled "Notion-Like Tables").

Detailed configuration for DRUIDS-specific use cases is a separate task and will be documented elsewhere.
