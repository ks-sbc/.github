# Tasks (Obsidian Tasks)

## Purpose

The Tasks plugin provides a robust way to manage to-do items within your Obsidian vault. In DRUIDS, it's key for tracking action items from meetings, managing project tasks, assigning responsibilities, monitoring progress within the Theory-Plan-Practice-Summation cycle, and enhancing accountability.

## Installation Steps

1.  Navigate to Settings (gear icon) > Community Plugins.
2.  If community plugins are not yet enabled, click "Turn on community plugins" (and accept any warning).
3.  Click "Browse" to open the community plugins modal.
4.  In the search bar, type "Tasks".
5.  Find the "Tasks" plugin (often listed as "Obsidian Tasks") in the search results and click on it.
6.  Click the "Install" button.
7.  Once installed, click the "Enable" button.
8.  Close the community plugins modal.

## Configuration

Plugin settings can usually be found under Settings > Community Plugins > Tasks or in its own dedicated section in the Settings sidebar (often labeled "Tasks").

Detailed configuration for DRUIDS-specific use cases (e.g., task formats, query syntax for task reporting) is a separate task and will be documented elsewhere.
