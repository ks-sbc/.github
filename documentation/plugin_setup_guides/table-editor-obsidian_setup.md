# Table Editor (Obsidian Advanced Tables)

## Purpose

Often referred to as "Advanced Tables," this plugin greatly simplifies working with Markdown tables by providing features like auto-formatting, tab navigation between cells, and easy row/column manipulation. For DRUIDS, this makes creating and maintaining structured information in tables much more efficient for any document.

2.  If community plugins are not yet enabled, click "Turn on community plugins" (and accept any warning).
3.  Click "Browse" to open the community plugins modal.
4.  In the search bar, type "Advanced Tables" or "Table Editor". (The plugin is widely known as "Advanced Tables").
5.  Find the plugin (likely listed as "Advanced Tables" by `tgrosinger`) in the search results and click on it.
6.  Click the "Install" button.
7.  Once installed, click the "Enable" button.
8.  Close the community plugins modal.

## Configuration

Plugin settings can usually be found under Settings > Community Plugins > Advanced Tables or in its own dedicated section in the Settings sidebar.
