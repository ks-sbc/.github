# Style Settings

## Purpose

The Style Settings plugin provides a standardized way for themes and snippets to expose configuration options to users via a settings panel. It's particularly useful with themes like Minimal. For DRUIDS, it allows for fine-grained control over visual elements, including those relevant for security indicators (colors, fonts, etc.), without directly editing CSS, making customization more accessible.

## Installation Steps

1.  Navigate to Settings (gear icon) > Community Plugins.
2.  If community plugins are not yet enabled, click "Turn on community plugins" (and accept any warning).
3.  Click "Browse" to open the community plugins modal.
4.  In the search bar, type "Style Settings".
5.  Find the "Style Settings" plugin in the search results and click on it.
6.  Click the "Install" button.
7.  Once installed, click the "Enable" button.
8.  Close the community plugins modal.

## Configuration

Plugin settings can usually be found under Settings > Community Plugins > Style Settings or in its own dedicated section in the Settings sidebar (often labeled "Style Settings"). Themes and snippets that support Style Settings will populate their options here.

Detailed configuration for DRUIDS-specific use cases (e.g., specific styles for security tiers or UI elements) is a separate task and will be documented elsewhere.
