# Kanban

## Purpose

The Kanban plugin provides a visual way to manage workflows and tasks using Kanban boards within Obsidian. For DRUIDS, this is invaluable for tracking progress through the Theory-Plan-Practice-Summation cycle, managing project phases, and visualizing workflows for content creation or organizational initiatives.

## Installation Steps

1.  Navigate to Settings (gear icon) > Community Plugins.
2.  If community plugins are not yet enabled, click "Turn on community plugins" (and accept any warning).
3.  Click "Browse" to open the community plugins modal.
4.  In the search bar, type "Kanban".
5.  Find the "Kanban" plugin in the search results and click on it.
6.  Click the "Install" button.
7.  Once installed, click the "Enable" button.
8.  Close the community plugins modal.

## Configuration

Plugin settings can usually be found under Settings > Community Plugins > Kanban or in its own dedicated section in the Settings sidebar (often labeled "Kanban").

Detailed configuration for DRUIDS-specific use cases (e.g., board templates, workflow stages) is a separate task and will be documented elsewhere.
