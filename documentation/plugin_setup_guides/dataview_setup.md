# Dataview

## Purpose

Dataview is a powerful plugin that allows you to query, list, table, and track data from your notes. For DRUIDS, it's essential for creating dynamic tables of content, tracking tasks, generating reports on organizational metrics, managing project statuses, and implementing aspects of the democratic centralist workflow by making information transparent and queryable.

## Installation Steps

1.  Navigate to Settings (gear icon) > Community Plugins.
2.  If community plugins are not yet enabled, click "Turn on community plugins" (and accept any warning).
3.  Click "Browse" to open the community plugins modal.
4.  In the search bar, type "Dataview".
5.  Find the "Dataview" plugin in the search results and click on it.
6.  Click the "Install" button.
7.  Once installed, click the "Enable" button.
8.  Close the community plugins modal.

## Configuration

Plugin settings can usually be found under Settings > Community Plugins > Dataview or in its own dedicated section in the Settings sidebar (often labeled "Dataview").

Detailed configuration for DRUIDS-specific use cases (e.g., query syntax, script settings) is a separate task and will be documented elsewhere.
