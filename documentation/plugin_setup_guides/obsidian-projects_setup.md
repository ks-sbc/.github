# Projects

## Purpose

The Projects plugin offers advanced project management capabilities, allowing you to organize notes and tasks into projects with different views like tables, boards, and calendars. In DRUIDS, it can be used for managing larger organizational initiatives, tracking progress across multiple documents, and providing overviews of ongoing work.

## Installation Steps

1.  Navigate to Settings (gear icon) > Community Plugins.
2.  If community plugins are not yet enabled, click "Turn on community plugins" (and accept any warning).
3.  Click "Browse" to open the community plugins modal.
4.  In the search bar, type "Projects".
5.  Find the "Projects" plugin in the search results and click on it.
6.  Click the "Install" button.
7.  Once installed, click the "Enable" button.
8.  Close the community plugins modal.

## Configuration

Plugin settings can usually be found under Settings > Community Plugins > Projects or in its own dedicated section in the Settings sidebar (often labeled "Projects").

Detailed configuration for DRUIDS-specific use cases (e.g., project templates, custom views) is a separate task and will be documented elsewhere.
