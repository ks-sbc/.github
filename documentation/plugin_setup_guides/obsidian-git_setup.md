# Obsidian Git

## Purpose

Obsidian Git allows you to manage your vault with Git version control directly from within Obsidian. This is fundamental for DRUIDS, enabling collaborative editing, version history, branching for proposals, and integration with GitHub for backup, review, and democratic approval processes. It supports features like automated commits and pulling/pushing changes.

## Installation Steps

1.  Navigate to Settings (gear icon) > Community Plugins.
2.  If community plugins are not yet enabled, click "Turn on community plugins" (and accept any warning).
3.  Click "Browse" to open the community plugins modal.
4.  In the search bar, type "Obsidian Git".
5.  Find the "Obsidian Git" plugin in the search results and click on it.
6.  Click the "Install" button.
7.  Once installed, click the "Enable" button.
8.  Close the community plugins modal.

## Configuration

Plugin settings can usually be found under Settings > Community Plugins > Obsidian Git or in its own dedicated section in the Settings sidebar (often labeled "Obsidian Git").

Detailed configuration for DRUIDS-specific use cases (e.g., commit automation, authentication with GitHub) is a separate task and will be documented elsewhere.
