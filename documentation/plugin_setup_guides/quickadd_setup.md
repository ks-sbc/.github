# QuickAdd

## Purpose

QuickAdd is a powerful automation plugin that allows you to create macros and commands for capturing thoughts, creating notes from templates with prompts, and automating various repetitive tasks. For DRUIDS, it will be used to streamline document creation workflows (e.g., quickly creating new meeting minutes or issue notes), automate metadata assignment, and trigger complex actions.

## Installation Steps

1.  Navigate to Settings (gear icon) > Community Plugins.
2.  If community plugins are not yet enabled, click "Turn on community plugins" (and accept any warning).
3.  Click "Browse" to open the community plugins modal.
4.  In the search bar, type "QuickAdd".
5.  Find the "QuickAdd" plugin in the search results and click on it.
6.  Click the "Install" button.
7.  Once installed, click the "Enable" button.
8.  Close the community plugins modal.

## Configuration

Plugin settings can usually be found under Settings > Community Plugins > QuickAdd or in its own dedicated section in the Settings sidebar (often labeled "QuickAdd").

Detailed configuration for DRUIDS-specific use cases (e.g., macros, capture choices, template configurations) is a separate task and will be documented elsewhere.
