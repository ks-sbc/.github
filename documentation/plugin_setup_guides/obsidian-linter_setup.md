# Linter

## Purpose

The Linter plugin helps maintain consistent formatting and style in your Markdown files. For DRUIDS, it will be used to enforce documentation standards, validate metadata (e.g., frontmatter fields), and ensure that documents adhere to agreed-upon conventions, contributing to clarity and ideological coherence.

## Installation Steps

1.  Navigate to Settings (gear icon) > Community Plugins.
2.  If community plugins are not yet enabled, click "Turn on community plugins" (and accept any warning).
3.  Click "Browse" to open the community plugins modal.
4.  In the search bar, type "Linter".
5.  Find the "Linter" plugin in the search results and click on it.
6.  Click the "Install" button.
7.  Once installed, click the "Enable" button.
8.  Close the community plugins modal.

## Configuration

Plugin settings can usually be found under Settings > Community Plugins > Linter or in its own dedicated section in the Settings sidebar (often labeled "Linter").

Detailed configuration for DRUIDS-specific use cases (e.g., specific linting rules, YAML frontmatter validation) is a separate task and will be documented elsewhere.
