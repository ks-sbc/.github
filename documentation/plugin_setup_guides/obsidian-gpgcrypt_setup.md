# GPG Crypt (obsidian-gpgcrypt)

## Purpose

The GPG Crypt plugin allows for encryption and decryption of content within Obsidian notes using GPG (GNU Privacy Guard). For DRUIDS, this is a critical component for protecting L1 and especially L2 (Cadre) classified information, enabling secure storage of sensitive documents directly within the vault, and integrating with hardware key-based GPG setups.

## Installation Steps

1.  Navigate to Settings (gear icon) > Community Plugins.
2.  If community plugins are not yet enabled, click "Turn on community plugins" (and accept any warning).
3.  Click "Browse" to open the community plugins modal.
4.  In the search bar, type "GPG Crypt" or "obsidian-gpgcrypt".
5.  Find the "GPG Crypt" plugin in the search results and click on it.
6.  Click the "Install" button.
7.  Once installed, click the "Enable" button.
8.  Close the community plugins modal.

## Configuration

Plugin settings can usually be found under Settings > Community Plugins > GPG Crypt or in its own dedicated section in the Settings sidebar (often labeled "GPG Crypt").

Detailed configuration for DRUIDS-specific use cases (e.g., GPG key setup, integration with hardware keys) is a separate task and will be documented elsewhere. This will require users to have GPG installed and configured on their system.
