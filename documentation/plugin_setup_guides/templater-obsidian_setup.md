# Templater

## Purpose

Templater is an advanced templating plugin that allows you to create new notes from pre-defined structures. In DRUIDS, it's crucial for ensuring consistency in document creation (e.g., meeting minutes, study guides, project proposals), automating metadata (like creation dates, security classifications), and enforcing standardized formats that align with democratic centralist processes.

## Installation Steps

1.  Navigate to Settings (gear icon) > Community Plugins.
2.  If community plugins are not yet enabled, click "Turn on community plugins" (and accept any warning).
3.  Click "Browse" to open the community plugins modal.
4.  In the search bar, type "Templater".
5.  Find the "Templater" plugin in the search results and click on it.
6.  Click the "Install" button.
7.  Once installed, click the "Enable" button.
8.  Close the community plugins modal.

## Configuration

Plugin settings can usually be found under Settings > Community Plugins > Templater or in its own dedicated section in the Settings sidebar (often labeled "Templater").

Detailed configuration for DRUIDS-specific use cases (e.g., template creation, user functions) is a separate task and will be documented elsewhere.
