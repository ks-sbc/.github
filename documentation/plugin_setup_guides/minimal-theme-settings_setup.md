# Minimal Theme Settings

## Purpose

Minimal Theme Settings provides a user interface within Obsidian's settings to customize the appearance of the Minimal theme. While `obsidian-style-settings` offers broader control over theme variables, this plugin is specifically for tweaking Minimal's own built-in options. For DRUIDS, it helps fine-tune the visual environment for clarity and user preference while using the Minimal theme.

## Installation Steps

1.  Navigate to Settings (gear icon) > Community Plugins.
2.  If community plugins are not yet enabled, click "Turn on community plugins" (and accept any warning).
3.  Click "Browse" to open the community plugins modal.
4.  In the search bar, type "Minimal Theme Settings".
5.  Find the "Minimal Theme Settings" plugin in the search results and click on it.
6.  Click the "Install" button.
7.  Once installed, click the "Enable" button.
8.  Close the community plugins modal.

## Configuration

Plugin settings can usually be found under Settings > Community Plugins > Minimal Theme Settings or in its own dedicated section in the Settings sidebar (often labeled "Minimal Theme Settings"). This plugin is most effective when the "Minimal" theme is also selected under Settings > Appearance > Themes.

Detailed configuration for DRUIDS-specific use cases (e.g., specific theme settings for visual cues) is a separate task and will be documented elsewhere.
