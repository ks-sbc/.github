# Shell Commands

## Purpose

The Shell Commands plugin allows you to define and execute custom shell commands directly from Obsidian. In DRUIDS, this can be used for a wide range of automation tasks, such as triggering Git operations (beyond what Obsidian Git offers), running scripts for content validation or processing, integrating with hardware keys, or automating other system-level interactions.

## Installation Steps

1.  Navigate to Settings (gear icon) > Community Plugins.
2.  If community plugins are not yet enabled, click "Turn on community plugins" (and accept any warning).
3.  Click "Browse" to open the community plugins modal.
4.  In the search bar, type "Shell Commands".
5.  Find the "Shell Commands" plugin in the search results and click on it.
6.  Click the "Install" button.
7.  Once installed, click the "Enable" button.
8.  Close the community plugins modal.

## Configuration

Plugin settings can usually be found under Settings > Community Plugins > Shell Commands or in its own dedicated section in the Settings sidebar (often labeled "Shell Commands").

Detailed configuration for DRUIDS-specific use cases (e.g., defining specific commands, security considerations for executing shell scripts) is a separate task and will be documented elsewhere.
