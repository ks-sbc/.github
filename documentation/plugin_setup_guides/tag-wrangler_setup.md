# Tag Wrangler

## Purpose

Tag Wrangler provides tools for managing your tags, including renaming, merging, and searching for tags. In DRUIDS, where tags will be important for metadata, security classification, and content organization, this plugin helps maintain a clean and consistent tag vocabulary across the vault.

## Installation Steps

1.  Navigate to Settings (gear icon) > Community Plugins.
2.  If community plugins are not yet enabled, click "Turn on community plugins" (and accept any warning).
3.  Click "Browse" to open the community plugins modal.
4.  In the search bar, type "Tag Wrangler".
5.  Find the "Tag Wrangler" plugin in the search results and click on it.
6.  Click the "Install" button.
7.  Once installed, click the "Enable" button.
8.  Close the community plugins modal.

## Configuration

Plugin settings can usually be found under Settings > Community Plugins > Tag Wrangler or in its own dedicated section in the Settings sidebar (often labeled "Tag Wrangler").

Detailed configuration for DRUIDS-specific use cases (e.g., tag management workflows) is a separate task and will be documented elsewhere.
